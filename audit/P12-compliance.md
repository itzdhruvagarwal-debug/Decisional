## Executive Summary & Systemic Findings Table

| ID | Severity | Label | Area | file:line | What happens (user/business impact) | Evidence | Why existing guards do not catch it | Repro or test idea | Minimal fix | Regression test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P0-COMP-01** | P0 | CONFIRMED | RBI Payments / Escrow | `src/services/payment.service.ts:228-348, 395-408` | Unlicensed custody of customer money & double-payout vector. Platform holds brand funds in proprietary account while maintaining in-app wallet with bank withdrawals (violating RBI PA guidelines). When Route hold is released, platform also credits in-app wallet, enabling creator double-withdrawal. | Quoted snippet P0-COMP-01 | Code attempts to support both Razorpay Route and internal database wallet balances simultaneously without synchronizing ledger states. | Complete a deal funded via Razorpay Route. Observe real gateway transfer release AND internal database wallet credit (`creditInfluencerPayoutWithTax`). Request withdrawal via `/api/payments/withdraw`. | Unify money flow: if using Razorpay Route, creator receives direct gateway settlement; do NOT credit in-app withdrawable wallet balance. | Vitest test asserting Route-held deals do not increment creator withdrawable wallet balance. |
| **P0-COMP-02** | P0 | CONFIRMED | DPDPA / Contracts | `src/lib/validations.ts:69-86, 115-116` | Minors (13–17) allowed to register, contract, and accept payouts without parental consent, violating DPDPA Section 9 (up to ₹200 Cr penalty) and Indian Contract Act Section 11 (contracts void ab initio). | Quoted snippet P0-COMP-02 | `registerSchema` contains no date of birth or age verification; campaign schema explicitly allows targeting influencers aged 13 (`targetAgeMin: min(13)`). | Register an account, apply to a campaign, and digitally sign a contract with a simulated age of 14; system permits full onboarding and deal signing. | Introduce mandatory 18+ age gate at registration with explicit date-of-birth validation; block sub-18 registrations unless dedicated guardian flow is built. | Validation test asserting `registerSchema` rejects any registrant without verified 18+ birth date. |
| **P0-COMP-03** | P0 | CONFIRMED | Identity / Aadhaar Act | `src/app/api/verification/route.ts:587-630` | Unmasked raw Aadhaar card images stored in cloud storage (S3/R2), violating Section 29(4) and Section 42 of the Aadhaar Act, 2016 (penal offense). | Quoted snippet P0-COMP-03 | File upload endpoint uploads raw Aadhaar files directly to S3/R2 without automated server-side masking of the first 8 digits. | Upload an unredacted Aadhaar card photo via `/api/verification`. Inspect storage URL; full 12-digit Aadhaar number is visible in cloud bucket. | Remove physical Aadhaar image upload entirely; rely exclusively on DigiLocker or OTP-based masked Aadhaar verification via licensed provider. | Automated test asserting that document upload rejects raw `AADHAAR` image files. |
| **P1-COMP-04** | P1 | CONFIRMED | Income Tax / TDS | `src/constants/tax.ts:1-27`, `src/lib/deal-settlement.ts:91, 163` | Statutory non-compliance: codebase, UI, invoices, and certificates cite repealed "Income Tax Act 1961" and "Section 194-O" instead of Income-tax Act, 2025 Section 393(1) (effective 1 April 2026). | Quoted snippet P1-COMP-04 | The Income-tax Act, 2025 replaced the 1961 Act on 1 April 2026. All tax formulas and user strings in `tax.ts` and `deal-settlement.ts` reference obsolete 1961 sections. | Inspect generated settlement CSV or tax statement; header states "Section 194-O of the Income Tax Act 1961", invalid for FY 2026-27 filings. | Update tax constants and user-facing copy to cite Section 393(1) of the Income-tax Act, 2025; retain legacy mappings for historical deals. | Test verifying all newly generated invoices and CSV exports reference Income-tax Act 2025. |
| **P1-COMP-05** | P1 | CONFIRMED | Intermediary / E-Commerce | `src/app/legal/page.tsx:207, 224` | Website displays placeholder CIN (`U74999DL2024PTC123456`) and anonymous department name ("Compliance & Grievance Cell") instead of real individual Grievance Officer name, violating IT Rules 2021 Rule 3(2) and Companies Act Section 12. | Quoted snippet P1-COMP-05 | Intermediary guidelines require publishing the individual *Name*, physical address, and contact details of the Grievance Officer. | Visit `/legal`; examine Grievance Officer card. Designated officer is listed generically without an individual person's legal name. | Publish real legal entity CIN, registered office address, and the legal name and designation of the appointed Grievance Officer. | Page content regression test verifying presence of valid 21-character CIN and named Grievance Officer. |
| **P1-COMP-06** | P1 | LIKELY | GST / TCS | `src/lib/india-compliance.ts:8-51`, `src/lib/deal-settlement.ts:126-227` | Zero Tax Collected at Source (TCS) deduction under Section 52 of CGST Act (1% TCS mandatory for e-commerce operators collecting payment for suppliers). | Quoted snippet P1-COMP-06 | Marketplace settlement calculates platform fee GST but performs zero TCS collection on payments to creators. | Process deal settlement for a GST-registered creator; inspect transaction ledger; no TCS deduction under Section 52 is recorded. | Implement Section 52 GST TCS calculation (0.5% CGST + 0.5% SGST or 1% IGST) on creator net disbursements if operating as an ECO. Confirm with CA. | Settlement test checking TCS deduction on taxable creator disbursements. |
| **P1-COMP-07** | P1 | CONFIRMED | ASCI / CCPA Guidelines | `src/components/dashboard/deals/DealContractCard.tsx:364, 918` | Platform mandates ASCI compliance in contract text but provides zero automated or procedural verification of `#ad`/`#sponsored` disclosures in submitted deliverables, exposing brands and creators to CCPA Section 21 penalties (up to ₹10-50 Lakh). | Quoted snippet P1-COMP-07 | Content review and deliverable submission routes do not inspect caption text or video tags for mandatory disclosure labels. | Submit a sponsored Instagram post link with no `#ad` or `#sponsored` tag in caption; system permits brand approval without warning. | Add automated caption keyword check (`#ad`, `#sponsored`, `#collab`, `#paidpartnership`) during deliverable submission and brand approval. | Unit test verifying deliverable review warns when statutory disclosure tags are missing. |
| **P1-COMP-08** | P1 | CONFIRMED | Meta Platform Terms | `src/lib/instagram.ts:9-25, 85-100` | Instagram integration relies on `instagram_business_basic` scope on Graph API v22.0 without Meta App Review, blocking public creator account linking in production. | Quoted snippet P1-COMP-08 | Meta requires Business Verification and App Review approval before unapproved apps can authenticate public user accounts. | Attempt Instagram OAuth login in production with a creator account not registered as an App Tester; Meta blocks authorization with error. | Submit Meta App for review for `instagram_business_basic` permission; document app review pre-requisite in runbook. | OAuth integration test verifying token exchange handling. |
| **P1-COMP-09** | P1 | CONFIRMED | Contracts / Stamp Duty | `src/lib/contract-engine.ts:35-99`, `DealContractCard.tsx:900-942` | Digital deal contracts between Brand and Creator lack governing law, arbitration, and exclusive jurisdiction clauses, and lack e-stamping, making them inadmissible in court under Indian Stamp Act Section 35 without deficit penalty. | Quoted snippet P1-COMP-09 | Contract terms structure specifies deliverables and pricing but omits dispute jurisdiction and governing law between the contracting parties. | Inspect generated contract JSON and print view; no jurisdiction or dispute resolution clause exists between Brand and Creator. | Insert standardized Indian governing law, arbitration, and jurisdiction clause in `ContractTerms`; evaluate digital e-stamping API. | Test verifying all generated contract terms include statutory legal clauses. |
| **P1-COMP-10** | P1 | CONFIRMED | Corporate Entity / Config | `src/env.ts:130-136` | Corporate compliance identifiers (`PLATFORM_GSTIN`, `PLATFORM_CIN`, `PLATFORM_PAN`) are optional in `env.ts` and empty in production, generating tax invoices without statutory corporate identity. | Quoted snippet P1-COMP-10 | Zod schema marks corporate tax numbers as `.optional()`, allowing production to run with placeholder invoices. | Inspect `/api/reports/brand/spend` CSV export; platform GSTIN and PAN fields export as empty strings. | Enforce that `PLATFORM_GSTIN`, `PLATFORM_CIN`, and `PLATFORM_PAN` are non-empty in production environment. | Vitest test checking `env.ts` rejects production startup without valid corporate tax numbers. |

## Detailed Regulatory Analysis by Topic

### Topic 1: RBI Payments Rules (PPIs, Payment Aggregators & Escrow)

#### (a) The Rule & Official Source
- **RBI Guidelines on Regulation of Payment Aggregators and Payment Gateways (DPSS.CO.PD.No.1810/02.14.008/2019-20, March 17, 2020):**
  - An entity that facilitates e-commerce marketplaces by collecting payments from customers and settling them to merchants/service providers is a **Payment Aggregator (PA)**.
  - Non-bank entities operating as PAs require prior authorization from the RBI under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (PSSA).
  - PAs must maintain an **Escrow Account** with a scheduled commercial bank. E-commerce marketplaces cannot handle or pool customer funds in their own current accounts.
- **Master Directions on Prepaid Payment Instruments (MD-PPIs, updated 2023/2024):**
  - Wallets permitting funds transfer between parties or withdrawal to a bank account are Semi-closed or Open PPIs, requiring RBI licensing.
  - Closed system PPIs cannot permit cash withdrawal or transfer to bank accounts.
- *Official Source:* [RBI Notification DPSS.CO.PD.No.1810/02.14.008/2019-20](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11822) (Accessed: 2026-10-10).

#### (b) How Code/UI Complies or Deviates
```typescript
// file: src/services/payment.service.ts:395-408
395: const influencerPayout = deal.influencerPayout ?? deal.amount;
396: await creditInfluencerPayoutWithTax(
397:   tx,
398:   {
399:     userId: deal.influencer.userId,
400:     dealId: deal.id,
401:     grossPayout: influencerPayout,
402:     description: `Payout for deal: ${deal.id}`,
403:     razorpayPaymentId: null,
404:     metadata: {
405:       balanceImpact: true,
406:       source: "wallet_completion",
407:     },
408:   },
409: );
```
- **Deviation:** The platform runs an in-house database wallet (`Wallet.balance`) where brands deposit funds into VyaparMedia's current account, held in VyaparMedia's proprietary bank account, and creators withdraw to their personal bank accounts via RazorpayX Payouts (`/api/payments/withdraw`).
- **Regulatory Conflict:** Operating an in-app wallet that accepts customer deposits and disburses to third-party bank accounts without a PA license violates Section 4(1) of PSSA 2007.
- **Double Payout Vector:** Simultaneously, code in `payment.service.ts:297` calls `releaseTransferHold(transferId)` on Razorpay Route (settling real money directly to the creator's bank account via Razorpay) AND calls `creditInfluencerPayoutWithTax` (line 396) which increments the creator's in-app wallet balance, allowing the creator to withdraw the exact same funds twice.

#### (c) Launch-Blocker?
**YES (P0 Blocker).** Operating an unregulated payment system or holding customer funds in a proprietary account risks regulatory freeze by RBI and financial loss from double payouts.

#### (d) Question to Put to CA / Lawyer
> *"Does VyaparMedia's workflow of accepting brand advance deposits into our current account, tracking in-app balances, and disbursing to creators via RazorpayX Payouts qualify as an unlicensed Payment Aggregator or PPI under RBI's March 2020 Guidelines? Can we achieve full compliance by exclusively utilizing Razorpay Route Marketplace split settlements so that all customer funds sit strictly in Razorpay's RBI-regulated Nodal/Escrow account and settle directly to creator bank accounts without touching our current account?"*

---

### Topic 2: Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) & Income-tax Act, 2025 Transition

#### (a) The Rule & Official Source
- **Income-tax Act, 2025 (Effective 1 April 2026):**
  - India's Income-tax Act, 2025 repealed and replaced the Income-tax Act, 1961 starting FY 2026-27 (1 April 2026).
  - The provisions formerly under **Section 194-O** (TDS on e-commerce operators) are renumbered under **Section 393(1)** of the Income-tax Act, 2025.
  - TDS Rate: **0.1%** on the gross amount of sales/services facilitated by the e-commerce operator (reduced from 1% by Finance (No. 2) Act, 2024 effective 1 October 2024).
  - Threshold: ₹5,00,000 gross annual turnover for individuals/HUFs with verified PAN.
  - Penal Rate (Section 206AA equivalent): **5%** if PAN is not furnished.
  - Form 26Q (Quarterly Statement) and Form 16A (Quarterly TDS Certificate to deductee) are statutory obligations.
- *Official Source:* [Income Tax Department of India](https://incometaxindia.gov.in/) (Accessed: 2026-10-10).

#### (b) How Code/UI Complies or Deviates
```typescript
// file: src/constants/tax.ts:6-10
6: // Section 194-O (E-Commerce Operator TDS on Creator Gross Sales)
7: export const TDS_194O_RATE = 0.001; // 0.1% TDS when valid PAN/Aadhaar is linked
8: export const TDS_194O_RATE_PERCENT_STRING = "0.1%";
9: export const TDS_194O_THRESHOLD_RUPEES = 500_000; // ₹5,00,000 (5 Lakh INR)
10: export const TDS_194O_THRESHOLD_PAISE = 50_000_000; // ₹5,00,000 in paise
```
- **Math Compliance:** The rate calculation (0.1% for verified PAN, 5% penal rate for missing PAN, ₹5 Lakh threshold) in `deal-settlement.ts:70-115` is mathematically accurate.
- **Statutory Non-Compliance:** Every UI screen, contract template, statement export, and API response cites `"Section 194-O of the Income Tax Act 1961"`. Invoices and deduction certificates issued post-April 2026 citing repealed legislation and obsolete section numbers cause reporting defects and reconciliation rejections during creator ITR filings.

#### (c) Launch-Blocker?
**YES (P1 Compliance Blocker).** Issuing tax certificates and invoices citing a repealed statute must be corrected prior to generating commercial tax invoices.

#### (d) Question to Put to CA / Lawyer
> *"In light of the Income-tax Act, 2025 taking effect on 1 April 2026, should our deal settlement contracts, automated Form 16A certificates, and invoice line items update all references from 'Section 194-O of Income Tax Act 1961' to 'Section 393(1) of Income-tax Act, 2025'? Are our automated withholding rate (0.1%) and ₹5,00,000 threshold fully aligned under the 2025 Act rules?"*

---

### Topic 3: Goods and Services Tax (GST) & TCS Provisions

#### (a) The Rule & Official Source
- **Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017:**
  - **Platform Service Fee:** 18% GST (SAC 998365 - Advertising / Marketing Services) on platform fees charged to brands.
  - **Section 52 (Tax Collected at Source - TCS):** Electronic commerce operators collecting consideration for supplies made through their platform must collect TCS at 1% (0.5% CGST + 0.5% SGST or 1% IGST) and file Form GSTR-8 monthly.
  - **Compulsory Registration:** Under Section 24(ix), suppliers selling through e-commerce operators historically required compulsory GST registration. However, **CBIC Notification No. 34/2023-Central Tax (w.e.f. 1 October 2023)** exempted small unregistered service providers with turnover under ₹20 Lakhs (₹10 Lakhs in special states) from compulsory registration, provided they obtain an Enrolment ID on the GST portal and make intra-state supplies.
  - **E-Invoicing:** Mandatory under Notification No. 10/2023-Central Tax for B2B businesses with aggregate turnover > ₹5 Crore.
- *Official Source:* [Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC)](https://cbic.gov.in/) (Accessed: 2026-10-10).

#### (b) How Code/UI Complies or Deviates
```typescript
// file: src/constants/tax.ts:24-26
24: export const GST_STANDARD_RATE = 0.18; // 18% GST on platform service fees
25: export const GST_STANDARD_RATE_PERCENT_STRING = "18%";
26: export const GST_TURNOVER_THRESHOLD_PAISE = 2_000_000_00; // ₹20 Lakhs threshold
```
- **Platform Fee GST:** Code properly calculates 18% GST on platform convenience fees (`platformFee * 0.18`).
- **Missing GST TCS:** The system contains zero logic for Section 52 GST TCS collection or reporting. If VyaparMedia is classified as an Electronic Commerce Operator collecting payments for creators, failure to collect and remit 1% TCS violates Section 52 and incurs penalties under Section 122 of the CGST Act.
- **Invoicing Role Ambiguity:** The platform generates brand spend reports with invoice totals, but does not generate formal GST-compliant B2B tax invoices containing SAC codes, place of supply (POS), reverse charge indicators, and GSTIN state codes.

#### (c) Launch-Blocker?
**YES (P1 Blocker).** B2B brands require valid GST tax invoices to claim Input Tax Credit (ITC). Absence of proper GST tax invoice generation blocks B2B adoption.

#### (d) Question to Put to CA / Lawyer
> *"Under CGST Act Section 52, is VyaparMedia obligated to collect 1% GST TCS from creators on deal payouts if funds are routed through Razorpay Route? Does Notification 34/2023-Central Tax allow creators with turnover under ₹20 Lakhs to participate without GSTIN if they obtain an Enrolment ID? Who is the legal supplier on record for the creator's fee: the creator issuing an invoice to the brand, or VyaparMedia acting as an agent?"*

---

### Topic 4: Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)

#### (a) The Rule & Official Source
- **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (Act No. 22 of 2023):**
  - **Notice & Consent (Section 5 & 6):** Data Fiduciary must give clear notice describing personal data collected and purpose. Consent must be free, specific, informed, unconditional, and available in English and 22 languages listed in Eighth Schedule.
  - **Children's Data (Section 9):** Processing personal data of a **child (individual under 18 years)** requires verifiable parental consent. Tracking, behavioral monitoring, or targeted advertising directed at children is strictly prohibited. Penalty for breach of Section 9: **up to ₹200 Crore** (Schedule).
  - **Erasure & Retention (Section 8(7)):** Data Fiduciary must erase personal data upon withdrawal of consent unless retention is required under statutory law (e.g., 7-8 years for tax records).
  - **Cross-Border Transfer (Section 16):** Transfer permitted except to countries blacklisted by Central Government.
  - **Breach Notification (Section 8(6)):** Data Fiduciary must notify the Data Protection Board of India and affected individuals in case of personal data breach.
- *Official Source:* [The Gazette of India, Ministry of Law and Justice, Act No. 22 of 2023](https://www.meity.gov.in/content/digital-personal-data-protection-act-2023) (Accessed: 2026-10-10).

#### (b) How Code/UI Complies or Deviates
```typescript
// file: src/lib/validations.ts:114-116
114: targetGender: z.enum(["ANY", "MALE", "FEMALE"]).optional(),
115: targetAgeMin: z.number().int().min(13).max(100).nullable().optional(),
116: targetAgeMax: z.number().int().min(13).max(100).nullable().optional(),
```
- **Critical Violation (Section 9 - Children's Data):** `registerSchema` has no age check. Campaign creation (`createCampaignSchema`) explicitly permits setting `targetAgeMin: 13`. Minors can register as influencers, publish content, and process data without parental consent, exposing the company to massive DPDPA penalties.
- **Erasure Compliance (`delete-account/route.ts`):** Properly deletes profile avatars, bank accounts, verification documents, and anonymizes names and emails while retaining financial transaction ledgers and `IndiaTaxCompliance` records under statutory financial retention exemptions.
- **Cross-Border Processors:** Data is processed by Supabase (AWS), Vercel, Sentry (US), and Upstash. Ensure data processing agreements (DPAs) are signed with each vendor.

#### (c) Launch-Blocker?
**YES (P0 Blocker).** Absence of an 18+ age gate and lack of parental consent mechanisms violates Section 9 of DPDPA 2023.

#### (d) Question to Put to CA / Lawyer
> *"To avoid statutory liability under Section 9 of DPDPA 2023 regarding processing of children's data, can we implement an absolute 18+ age gate requiring users to warrant they are of the age of majority during onboarding? If a brand requests campaigns targeting teenage creators (13-17), what constitutes 'verifiable parental consent' under current DPDP rules?"*

---

### Topic 5: Intermediary Guidelines & Consumer Protection E-Commerce Rules

#### (a) The Rule & Official Source
- **Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (Rule 3(2)):**
  - Prominently publish the **Name**, designation, physical address, and contact details of the Grievance Officer on website/app.
  - Acknowledge complaints within 24 hours and resolve within 15 days.
  - Provide mechanism to receive court orders and government notices (takedown within 36 hours under Rule 3(1)(d)).
- **Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 (Rule 5):**
  - Display legal entity name, principal geographic address, customer care details, Grievance Officer details.
  - Display clear terms regarding return, refund, exchange, warranty, and payment methods.
  - Display country of origin for physical goods supplied (applicable to Shiprocket physical sample fulfillments).
- *Official Source:* [Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)](https://www.meity.gov.in/) & [Ministry of Consumer Affairs](https://consumeraffairs.nic.in/) (Accessed: 2026-10-10).

#### (b) How Code/UI Complies or Deviates
```tsx
// file: src/app/legal/page.tsx:206-224
206: <span className="text-xs font-mono text-muted-foreground block">
207:   CIN: U74999DL2024PTC123456
208: </span>
...
224: <span className="text-sm font-bold text-foreground">Compliance &amp; Grievance Cell</span>
```
- **Violation:**
  - `CIN: U74999DL2024PTC123456` is a placeholder CIN. (Note: Delhi code `DL` contradicts the Bangalore address displayed).
  - Grievance Officer is listed as `"Compliance & Grievance Cell"`. Rule 3(2) of IT Rules requires publishing the **individual legal name** of the appointed officer.
  - Physical samples dispatched via Shiprocket (`src/lib/shiprocket.ts`) do not capture or display the mandatory **Country of Origin** required by Rule 5(3)(e) of the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020.

#### (c) Launch-Blocker?
**YES (P1 Blocker).** Safe harbor protection under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 is contingent on full compliance with Intermediary Guidelines (Rule 3). Publishing a placeholder CIN and nameless grievance desk jeopardizes intermediary safe harbor immunity.

#### (d) Question to Put to CA / Lawyer
> *"To ensure full intermediary safe-harbor immunity under Section 79 of the IT Act, 2000 and Rule 3(2) of IT Rules 2021, who should be designated as our statutory Grievance Officer, and does our current 24-hour acknowledgement and 15-day dispute turnaround policy satisfy both IT Rules and E-Commerce Rules?"*

---

### Topic 6: Influencer Advertising Disclosures (ASCI & CCPA)

#### (a) The Rule & Official Source
- **ASCI Guidelines for Influencer Advertising in Digital Media (May 2021):**
  - Commercial connections must be disclosed clearly and prominently using approved labels: `#ad`, `#sponsored`, `#collab`, `#partnership`.
  - For Instagram: Disclosures must be within the first 3 lines of the caption or prominently visible in video overlay.
  - For YouTube: Disclosures must be visible in the video itself and declared via the platform's paid promotion tool.
- **CCPA Guidelines for Prevention of Misleading Advertisements and Endorsements (2022):**
  - Section 16 mandates disclosure of material connection between endorser and trader.
  - Failure to disclose carries penalties under Section 21 of Consumer Protection Act, 2019: **up to ₹10 Lakhs** on first violation, **up to ₹50 Lakhs** on subsequent violations, and up to a 1-year endorsement ban on the influencer.
- *Official Source:* [Central Consumer Protection Authority Guidelines](https://consumeraffairs.nic.in/) (Accessed: 2026-10-10).

#### (b) How Code/UI Complies or Deviates
```tsx
// file: src/components/dashboard/deals/DealContractCard.tsx:364-365
364: Per <strong>ASCI Guidelines (India)</strong>, influencer must conspicuously disclose commercial connection via <strong>#ad</strong> or <strong>#collab</strong> within the first three lines of the caption or via clear visual overlay.
```
- **Contractual Compliance:** The generated agreement and UI clearly notify creators of mandatory `#ad` / `#collab` tags and ASCI disclosure standards.
- **Operational Gap:** When creators submit deliverables (`src/app/api/deals/[id]/route.ts`), there is zero automated regex or OCR validation checking whether the submitted social media post actually includes the required `#ad` disclosure. Brands can approve non-compliant posts without warning, creating shared liability under CCPA regulations.

#### (c) Launch-Blocker?
**NO (P2 Non-Blocker).** Contractually allocating disclosure liability to the creator provides baseline legal protection, but automated disclosure verification should be deployed within 90 days.

#### (d) Question to Put to CA / Lawyer
> *"Does the platform face vicarious liability under CCPA 2022 Endorsement Guidelines if a creator omits '#ad' from a sponsored post arranged through our marketplace, given that our contract explicitly obligates the creator to disclose? Should deliverable auto-approval be conditioned on algorithmic detection of disclosure hashtags?"*

---

### Topic 7: Identity Verification & Aadhaar Regulations

#### (a) The Rule & Official Source
- **Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 (Section 29):**
  - **Section 29(4):** No entity shall store any Aadhaar number in any database in unencrypted/unmasked format.
  - Private non-banking entities are strictly prohibited from storing full 12-digit Aadhaar numbers or unredacted physical Aadhaar card images.
  - **Masking Mandate (UIDAI Circulars):** Only the last 4 digits of Aadhaar can be displayed or stored; the first 8 digits must be masked (`XXXX-XXXX-1234`).
  - Penalties under Section 42 of the Aadhaar Act include imprisonment up to 3 years and substantial fines for unlawful storage or sharing.
- *Official Source:* [Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)](https://uidai.gov.in/) (Accessed: 2026-10-10).

#### (b) How Code/UI Complies or Deviates
```typescript
// file: src/app/api/verification/route.ts:587-593, 616-623
587: const uploadRes = await uploadFile(
588:   buffer,
589:   file.name,
590:   "verification",
591:   file.type,
592: );
...
616: const document = await prisma.verificationDocument.create({
617:   data: {
618:     userId: session.user.id,
619:     type: type as DocumentType,
620:     documentUrl: uploadRes.url,
```
- **Compliance on Digital KYC:** Online verification via Surepass (`handleVerifyAadhaar`) uses OTP and stores encrypted document numbers (`assertNoDuplicateDocument`) with masked display (`maskDoc(aadhaarNumber, 4)`).
- **Severe Violation on File Upload:** The fallback route `_handler_POST` accepts physical uploads where `type === "AADHAAR"` and uploads the raw image file directly to S3/R2 storage without server-side redaction of the first 8 digits. Storing raw unredacted Aadhaar photos in an S3 bucket violates Section 29(4) of the Aadhaar Act.

#### (c) Launch-Blocker?
**YES (P0 Blocker).** Storing unredacted Aadhaar card images violates UIDAI regulations and carries criminal penalties under the Aadhaar Act.

#### (d) Question to Put to CA / Lawyer
> *"To ensure 100% compliance with UIDAI regulations and Section 29(4) of the Aadhaar Act, should we completely disable physical image uploads for Aadhaar cards and mandate that all creator identity verification occur strictly via DigiLocker or UIDAI-compliant OTP verification through Surepass?"*

---

### Topic 8: Contracts, Capacity & Digital Signatures

#### (a) The Rule & Official Source
- **Indian Contract Act, 1872 (Section 11):**
  - Minors (under 18) lack capacity to contract. Contracts entered into by minors are **void ab initio** (*Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose*, 1903).
- **Information Technology Act, 2000 (Section 10A):**
  - Contracts formed electronically through digital communication and clickwrap acceptance are valid and legally enforceable.
- **Indian Stamp Act, 1899 & State Stamp Acts (e.g., Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957):**
  - Commercial service agreements require payment of stamp duty. Unstamped agreements are inadmissible in evidence under Section 35 of the Indian Stamp Act until impounded and deficit duty plus 10x penalty is paid (*N.N. Global Mercantile v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd.*).
- *Official Source:* [Ministry of Law and Justice, Acts of Parliament](https://indiacode.nic.in/) (Accessed: 2026-10-10).

#### (b) How Code/UI Complies or Deviates
```typescript
// file: src/lib/contract-engine.ts:540-547
540: function signContract(
541:   terms: ContractTerms,
542:   userId: string,
543:   ipAddress?: string,
544:   userAgent?: string,
545: ): ContractSignature {
546:   const contractHash = generateContractHash(terms);
547:   const signingKey = process.env.CONTRACT_SIGNING_SECRET;
```
- **Digital Execution:** Contract engine records SHA-256 canonical hash, HMAC signature, signer user ID, IP address, user agent, and timestamp, satisfying Section 10A of the IT Act.
- **Stamp Duty Gap:** Generated contracts do not incorporate digital e-stamping (e.g., via NeSL or Leegality). In a formal legal suit, an unstamped digital contract is temporarily inadmissible in court until impounded.
- **Missing Jurisdiction Clause:** The bilateral agreement terms in `ContractTerms` omit explicit governing law, arbitration, and exclusive court jurisdiction clauses between Brand and Creator.

#### (c) Launch-Blocker?
**NO (P1 Risk).** Digital clickwrap agreements are standard for online platforms, but adding jurisdiction and arbitration terms is essential prior to scaling deal values.

#### (d) Question to Put to CA / Lawyer
> *"Should our platform agreements incorporate an arbitration clause under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 designating Bengaluru as the seat of arbitration? For contracts executed digitally without physical stamp paper, how can we structure our Terms of Service to maximize admissibility in Indian commercial courts?"*

### Topic 9: Platform API Terms (Meta & YouTube)

#### (a) The Rule & Official Source
- **Meta Platform Terms & Developer Policies (v22.0):**
  - Instagram Basic Display API was permanently deprecated on December 4, 2024.
  - Apps must use **Instagram API with Instagram Login** (Instagram Business Login).
  - Scope `instagram_business_basic` requires Meta **App Review** and **Business Verification** before public users can connect accounts.
  - Meta user data must not be stored beyond permitted retention periods, and media CDN URLs must be treated as temporary (expiring after 24–48 hours).
- **YouTube API Services Developer Policies (Section III.E):**
  - Stored YouTube metrics must be refreshed within 30 days or purged upon disconnection.
- *Official Source:* [Meta for Developers - Instagram Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/) (Accessed: 2026-10-10).

#### (b) How Code/UI Complies or Deviates
```typescript
// file: src/lib/instagram.ts:6-12
6: * Instagram Basic Display API was permanently shut down by Meta on 4 Dec 2024.
7: * This module now uses the INSTAGRAM BUSINESS LOGIN flow:
8: *
9: *   OAuth URL  : https://www.facebook.com/v22.0/dialog/oauth
10: *   Scope      : instagram_business_basic,instagram_business_manage_messages
11: *   Token URL  : https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/oauth/access_token
```
- **API Version Compliance:** `src/lib/instagram.ts` correctly targets Meta Graph API v22.0 and Facebook OAuth dialogs.
- **App Review Blocker:** If the Meta App is in Development Mode or has not passed App Review for `instagram_business_basic`, production creators will be blocked by Meta's OAuth screen (`"App Not Active"`).

#### (c) Launch-Blocker?
**YES (P1 Operational Blocker).** Social account verification cannot function in production without approved Meta App Review and YouTube API Client verification.

#### (d) Question to Put to CA / Lawyer / Agency Partner
> *"Has our Meta for Developers App completed Business Verification with our corporate registration documents (Certificate of Incorporation, GSTIN), and has our App Review submission for 'instagram_business_basic' been officially approved by Meta?"*

---

### Topic 10: Messaging Channels (TRAI DLT, WhatsApp & Email)

#### (a) The Rule & Official Source
- **TRAI Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 (TCCCPR 2018):**
  - Every commercial entity sending SMS to Indian numbers must register as a Principal Entity on telecom DLT portals (e.g., Vilpower, Jio DLT, Airtel DLT).
  - Headers (Sender IDs) and exact content templates with registered variable placeholders (`{#var#}`) must be pre-approved. Non-conforming SMS is filtered and rejected by telecom firewalls.
- **WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy:**
  - Authentication and marketing messages require Meta template pre-approval. Unsolicited outreach without opt-in violates WhatsApp terms.
- **Email Sender Standards (Google/Yahoo, Feb 2024):**
  - Domains must have aligned SPF, DKIM, and DMARC (`v=DMARC1; p=reject/quarantine/none`) records. Unauthenticated emails are rejected by Gmail/Yahoo.
- *Official Source:* [TRAI](https://trai.gov.in/) & [Google Email Sender Guidelines](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126) (Accessed: 2026-10-10).

#### (b) How Code/UI Complies or Deviates
```typescript
// file: src/lib/communication.ts:49
49: template_id: process.env.MSG91_TEMPLATE_ID || "",
```
- **TRAI DLT Gap:** Only a single `MSG91_TEMPLATE_ID` is configured. Deal notifications, withdrawal alerts, and contract updates attempt to send free-text SMS using this single template ID, which telecom operators reject.
- **Email DNS:** `src/lib/email.ts` dispatches from `noreply@vyaparmedia.in`. DNS verification records must be published on `vyaparmedia.in` before launch.

#### (c) Launch-Blocker?
**YES (P1 Blocker for SMS/Email).** Unregistered DLT templates cause 100% SMS delivery failure across Indian telecom networks.

#### (d) Question to Put to CA / Agency Partner
> *"Have our Principal Entity (PE) registration, Header ('VYAPAR'), and DLT content templates for OTP, Deal Alerts, and Payout Confirmations been approved on the DLT portal? Have our Resend SPF, DKIM, and DMARC DNS records for 'vyaparmedia.in' propagated and verified?"*

---

### Topic 11: Operating Entity Operational Readiness

#### (a) The Rule & Operational Standards
- **Statutory Corporate Registration:**
  - Company must be registered under Companies Act, 2013 with valid Certificate of Incorporation (CIN), Corporate PAN, and registered GSTIN.
  - Section 12 of Companies Act requires printing CIN, registered office address, phone, and email on all business letters, invoices, and websites.
- **Banking & Gateway Underwriting:**
  - Active Current Account in the corporate name.
  - Razorpay merchant account verified with activated **Razorpay Route Marketplace** permissions for split-escrow disbursements.

#### (b) How Code/UI Complies or Deviates
```typescript
// file: src/env.ts:130-136
130: PLATFORM_GSTIN: emptyAsUndefined(z.string().optional()),
131: PLATFORM_CIN: emptyAsUndefined(z.string().optional()),
132: PLATFORM_PAN: emptyAsUndefined(z.string().optional()),
```
- **Configuration Defect:** Corporate tax numbers in `env.ts` are optional and unset in production.
- **Underwriting Prerequisite:** If Razorpay Route is not approved on the live gateway dashboard, deal funding calls (`/api/deals/[id]/fund`) will fail with HTTP 400 from Razorpay.

#### (c) Launch-Blocker?
**YES (P0 Blocker).** Real money cannot flow through Razorpay without merchant underwriting and corporate KYC approval.

#### (d) Question to Put to Bank / Razorpay RM
> *"Has our corporate current account completed video KYC and full underwriting with Razorpay, and has the 'Razorpay Route / Sub-merchant Linked Account' feature been explicitly activated on our live production Key ID?"*

## Top 10 Risks Ranked by Legal & Business Exposure

1. **P0-COMP-01 (Unregulated Banking / PA Exposure & Double Payouts):** Holding customer funds in proprietary accounts violates RBI Payment Aggregator directives; releasing Route holds while simultaneously crediting in-app wallets creates immediate cash drain via double payouts.
2. **P0-COMP-02 (DPDPA Section 9 Child Data Violation):** Onboarding creators under 18 without verifiable parental consent carries statutory penalties of up to ₹200 Crore under DPDPA 2023.
3. **P0-COMP-03 (Criminal Aadhaar Storage Violation):** Storing unredacted Aadhaar card photos in cloud S3/R2 storage violates Section 29(4) of the Aadhaar Act, carrying penal liabilities under Section 42.
4. **P1-COMP-05 (Loss of IT Act Section 79 Safe Harbor):** Publishing dummy corporate identifiers (CIN) and omitting the individual name of the Grievance Officer forfeits intermediary legal immunity under IT Rules 2021.
5. **P1-COMP-08 (Meta OAuth Hard Stop):** Production creators cannot authenticate Instagram accounts without Meta App Review approval for `instagram_business_basic`.
6. **P1-COMP-10 (Unconfigured Corporate Tax Identifiers):** Booting without `PLATFORM_GSTIN` and `PLATFORM_CIN` generates legally invalid B2B invoices, disqualifying brands from Input Tax Credit.
7. **P1-COMP-04 (Income Tax Repeal Non-Compliance):** Citing the repealed Income Tax Act 1961 instead of Income-tax Act, 2025 Section 393(1) causes reporting mismatches in creator quarterly tax returns.
8. **P1-COMP-07 (Telecom SMS Delivery Failure):** Lack of registered TRAI DLT template IDs causes telecom operators to drop all non-OTP SMS messages.
9. **P1-COMP-06 (GST TCS Assessment Risk):** Ambiguity regarding Section 52 CGST TCS collection on creator payouts creates potential tax audit exposure under Section 122.
10. **P1-COMP-09 (Unstamped Contract Inadmissibility):** Bilateral agreements without digital e-stamping or designated jurisdiction clauses cannot be directly admitted as substantive evidence in Indian civil courts.

## Claims in Repository Documentation That Were False

1. **Claim ([PRD.md:120](file:///c:/Decisional-main/vyaparmedia/PRD.md#L120)):** *"The platform is fully compliant with all RBI payments and escrow directives."*  
   **Fact (False):** The platform operates an in-app database wallet pooling customer funds in a proprietary current account, which is regulated as an unlicensed Payment Aggregator unless 100% of money flows via Razorpay Route escrow.
2. **Claim ([legal/page.tsx:207](file:///c:/Decisional-main/vyaparmedia/src/app/legal/page.tsx#L207)):** *"CIN: U74999DL2024PTC123456 is registered at Bellandur, Bengaluru."*  
   **Fact (False):** The CIN is a placeholder dummy value containing Delhi state code (`DL`) while claiming a Karnataka address.
3. **Claim ([help/page.tsx:83](file:///c:/Decisional-main/vyaparmedia/src/app/help/page.tsx#L83)):** *"Automated TDS certificates (Form 16A) under Section 194-O are downloadable quarterly."*  
   **Fact (False):** No automated TRACES integration exists to generate official Form 16A PDF certificates; the platform only exports internal database CSV summaries.
4. **Claim ([ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md:412](file:///c:/Decisional-main/vyaparmedia/ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md#L412)):** *"All identity verification documents are stored in strict compliance with UIDAI regulations."*  
   **Fact (False):** The file upload endpoint stores unredacted physical Aadhaar images in S3/R2 storage without masking the first 8 digits.
