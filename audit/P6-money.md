## 1. Executive Summary & Invariant Health Matrix

| Invariant | Description | Status | Primary Vulnerability / Finding | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **I1** | **Ledger Balance Equivalence** (`balance = \sum credits - \sum debits`) | **VIOLATED** | Phantom ledger entries with `metadata.balanceImpact: false` break standard double-entry queries and platform settlement cron. | **P1** |
| **I2** | **Idempotency Coverage Across Endpoints** | **VIOLATED** | Accept Application and Escrow Funding lack required idempotency keys; concurrent clicks trigger duplicate deals and escrow debits. | **P0** |
| **I3** | **External Gateway Ordering & Outbox** | **VIOLATED** | Shiprocket API calls occur before DB transaction commits; failed DB commits leave shipments active without billing the brand. Stuck withdrawal timeouts have no cron recovery. | **P0** |
| **I4** | **Fee & Tax Calculation Parity** | **VIOLATED** | TDS deductions create phantom ledger debits. GST (18%) referenced in tax reports is not charged on platform fees. | **P1** |
| **I5** | **Top-Up Security & Webhook Parity** | **VIOLATED** | Gateway refunds (`refund.processed`) and chargebacks are ignored and marked processed, allowing free wallet balance extraction. | **P0** |
| **I6** | **Withdrawal Integrity & Cooling Periods** | **VIOLATED** | New account cooling period checks User account age (`user.createdAt`) instead of Bank Account age (`bankAccount.createdAt`). | **P1** |
| **I7** | **Dispute Resolution & Escrow Settlement** | **VIOLATED** | Card-funded dispute resolutions attempt to decrement `brandWallet.pendingBalance` (which was never incremented), trapping disputes or draining unrelated funds. | **P0** |
| **I8** | **Admin Actions & Treasury Protection** | **VIOLATED** | Admin payout approve/reject lacks database `AuditLog` writes. `TDS_WITHHOLDING_TREASURY` lacks DB delete-protection triggers. | **P2** |
| **I9** | **Unit Hygiene (Paise vs. Rupee Consistency)** | **VIOLATED** | `/api/wallet/add-funds` expects Rupees (`amount * 100`), while `/api/payments/withdraw` expects Paise (`parsedAmountPaise`). | **P2** |
| **I10** | **Webhook Replay, Signatures & DLQ Retries** | **VIOLATED** | Unhandled webhook events are acknowledged and stored in `ProcessedWebhookEvent`, permanently disabling manual replays from DLQ. | **P1** |

## 2. In-Depth Invariant Analysis & Proofs (I1 – I10)

### Invariant I1: Ledger Balance Reconciliation
*For every wallet: stored balance equals the sum of ledger transactions; `available + pending + held` reconcile; balance is never negative.*

#### Theoretical Proof & Code Analysis
VyaparMedia implements database constraints in Postgres:
```sql
ALTER TABLE "Wallet" ADD CONSTRAINT check_wallet_balance_nonnegative CHECK (balance >= 0);
ALTER TABLE "Wallet" ADD CONSTRAINT check_wallet_pending_nonnegative CHECK ("pendingBalance" >= 0);
```
At the single-row database level, negative balances are blocked by PostgreSQL check constraints (`prisma/migrations/20260913120000_enterprise_scale_indexes_and_ledger_protection/migration.sql:67-71`).

**However, the fundamental ledger accounting equation (`wallet.balance == sum(credits) - sum(debits)`) is systematically violated by design.**
In `src/lib/deal-settlement.ts:166-183` and `src/lib/wallet-debt.ts:204-214`:
```typescript
// Deal Settlement: Influencer payout
await tx.transaction.create({
  data: {
    walletId: wallet.id,
    type: "DEBIT",
    amount: tdsAmount,
    status: "COMPLETED",
    description: `TDS deduction (Section ${appliedSection}, ${appliedRatePercent}) for deal: ${params.dealId}`,
    metadata: { balanceImpact: false, source: "tds_withholding" }
  }
});
```
When an influencer earns ₹10,000 with ₹1,000 TDS:
1. `wallet.balance` is incremented by **₹9,000** (`netPayout`).
2. A `CREDIT` transaction of **₹9,000** is created.
3. A `DEBIT` transaction of **₹1,000** is created with `metadata: { balanceImpact: false }`.

Any standard financial auditor or accounting software running `SUM(CREDITS) - SUM(DEBITS)` calculates:
$$\text{Calculated} = 9000 - 1000 = 8000 \neq 9000 (\text{Stored Balance})$$
The system suffers a phantom drift of ₹1,000 per taxed transaction.
To mask this, `src/lib/ledger-guard.ts:34-65` had to introduce special-cased string filtering on transaction descriptions:
```typescript
function impactsStoredWalletBalance(transaction: LedgerTransaction) {
  const metadata = getMetadataObject(transaction.metadata);
  if (metadata?.balanceImpact === false) return false;
  if (metadata?.balanceImpact === true) return true;
  const description = transaction.description || "";
  if (transaction.type === "DEBIT" && description.startsWith("TDS deduction")) return false;
  return true;
}
```
Worse, the production reconciliation cron in `src/app/api/cron/reconcile-ledger-settlements/route.ts:90-107` does **not** filter out `metadata.balanceImpact: false` or description strings:
```typescript
const [creditTransactions, debitTransactions] = await Promise.all([
  prisma.transaction.aggregate({ where: { status: "COMPLETED", type: { in: ["CREDIT", "REFUND"] } }, _sum: { amount: true } }),
  prisma.transaction.aggregate({ where: { status: "COMPLETED", type: { in: ["DEBIT", "WITHDRAWAL", "PLATFORM_FEE", "CLAWBACK", "CHARGEBACK"] } }, _sum: { amount: true } }),
]);
const ledgerToWalletDriftPaise = totalStoredBalancePaise - (creditTransactions._sum.amount - debitTransactions._sum.amount);
```
**Result**: In production, `reconcile-ledger-settlements` will permanently report false ledger drift for every completed deal with TDS.

---

### Invariant I2: Idempotency Coverage Across Money-Moving Endpoints
*Every money-affecting endpoint is idempotent under client retry, double click, network retry, and webhook redelivery.*

#### Audit of Money-Affecting Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Enforces `Idempotency-Key`? | Double-Click Safety Guard | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/wallet/add-funds` | POST | **Yes** (Strict 16-128 chars) | Claimed via Redis/DB in `addFundsSchema` | **SAFE** |
| `/api/payments/withdraw` | POST | **Yes** (Strict 16-128 chars) | Claimed in Redis + conditional DB lock | **SAFE** |
| `/api/deals/[id]/fund` | POST | **Optional** (Fallbacks to `Date.now()`) | If header omitted, two rapid clicks get different keys | **UNSAFE** |
| `/api/applications/[id]/accept` | POST | **No** | Prisma transaction without unique DB constraint on `(campaignId, influencerId)` | **VULNERABLE** |
| `/api/deals/[id]/sign` | POST | **No** | Serializable isolation level on contract signature | **SAFE** |
| `/api/deals/[id]/cancel` | POST | **No** | Atomic state machine transition | **SAFE** |
| `/api/admin/payouts/[id]` | PUT | **No** | Atomic update from `PENDING` -> `PROCESSING` | **UNSAFE ON RETRY** |

#### Proof of Vulnerability in `/api/applications/[id]/accept`
In `src/services/application/action.ts:180-230`:
```typescript
const existingDeal = await tx.deal.findFirst({
  where: { campaignId: application.campaignId, influencerId: application.influencerId, deletedAt: null, status: { not: "CANCELLED" } }
});
if (existingDeal) throw AppError.badRequest("A deal already exists for this influencer");
// Reserves funds from brand wallet pendingBalance:
await createDealAndReserveFunds(tx, { ... });
```
Because `prisma/schema.prisma` does not have a `@@unique([campaignId, influencerId])` constraint on `Deal` (see lines 705–730), two concurrent requests in `ReadCommitted` isolation level both execute `existingDeal = null`, both decrement `pendingBalance` from the brand wallet, and both create active deals for the exact same influencer application.

---

### Invariant I3: Ordering Between External Calls and DB Commits
*Ordering between external gateway calls (Razorpay/Shiprocket) and DB commits. Ambiguous gateway outcomes (timeouts) must never auto-retry into double payouts, and gateway failures must not leak platform liabilities.*

#### Critical Findings
1. **Shiprocket Shipment Billing Leakage (`src/services/deal/product.ts:208-255`)**:
   - `createCompleteShipment` calls the Shiprocket REST API synchronously to generate an order and courier AWB. This immediately charges VyaparMedia's Shiprocket commercial account.
   - Afterwards, `prisma.$transaction` runs to debit the brand's wallet.
   - If `brandWallet.balance < courierChargePaise`, or if a database deadlock occurs, the transaction rolls back with an exception.
   - **There is no compensation call to cancel the Shiprocket order in the catch block.**
   - The courier is booked, the label is live, and Shiprocket bills VyaparMedia, while the brand is never debited.
2. **Permanent Payout Trap on Ambiguous Network Timeouts (`src/app/api/admin/payouts/[id]/route.ts:151-163`)**:
   - When approving a payout, the route transitions the `Withdrawal` row to `PROCESSING`.
   - If Razorpay's API experiences a network timeout or connection reset:
     ```typescript
     if (isTimeoutOrNetworkError) {
       return { id: withdrawalId, status: "PROCESSING", isTimeoutOrNetworkError: true };
     }
     ```
   - The route does not save a `razorpayPayoutId` because none was returned.
   - `reconcile-payouts` cron (`src/app/api/cron/reconcile-payouts/route.ts:68`) **only reconciles Deals, completely ignoring Withdrawals**.
   - Admin UI cannot retry approval or rejection because lines 31 and 83 reject records not in `PENDING` or `PENDING_REVIEW` with `WITHDRAWAL_ALREADY_PROCESSED`.
   - **The money is permanently trapped**: creator's wallet balance remains deducted, and ops has no automated or manual way to unstick it.

---

### Invariant I4: Fee & Tax Math Parity
*One single formula for quote, escrow lock, release, refund, invoice. Same rounding everywhere. Sum of parts equals total for ANY amount.*

#### Code Verification
In `src/lib/razorpay.ts:108-115`:
```typescript
const safeProductHandlingFee = Math.max(0, Math.round(productHandlingFee || 0));
const platformFee = Math.round((dealAmount * platformFeePercent) / 100) + safeProductHandlingFee;
const gatewayFee = Math.round(((dealAmount + platformFee) * gatewayFeePercent) / 100);
const totalAmount = dealAmount + platformFee + gatewayFee;
```
- **Invariant holds**: `dealAmount + platformFee + gatewayFee === totalAmount` is mathematically exact because `totalAmount` is constructed by summing the integers.
- **Rounding property**: Every component is explicitly passed through `Math.round()`.
- **GST Discrepancy**: While `src/constants/tax.ts:24` defines `GST_STANDARD_RATE = 0.18`, and `src/app/api/reports/brand/spend/route.ts:131` generates GST invoices referencing CGST/SGST at 18%, `calculateTotalAmount` does **not** charge GST on the platform fee. Platform fee revenue in `recordPlatformFeeRevenue` is credited directly to `PLATFORM_TREASURY` without segregating GST liability to a tax treasury.

---

### Invariant I5: Top-Up Security & Webhook Parity
*Amount tampering, order binding to user, webhook vs client-side verify race, unhandled refund/chargeback webhooks.*

#### Critical Vulnerability: Unhandled Gateway Chargebacks & Refunds
In `src/app/api/webhooks/razorpay/process/route.ts:453-456`:
```typescript
// Acknowledge unhandled event types
await markWebhookProcessed(job.eventId, job.eventType, job.payload as Prisma.InputJsonValue);
return { success: true, message: `Event type ${event} acknowledged` };
```
- The webhook processor only handles `payment.captured`, `payout.*`, and `transfer.*`.
- Razorpay events such as `refund.processed`, `payment.refunded`, `chargeback.created`, and `dispute.created` fall through to line 454.
- They are marked as successfully processed in `ProcessedWebhookEvent` and return 200 OK.
- **Business Impact**: If a brand initiates a chargeback with their bank or receives a manual dashboard refund from Razorpay, the funds are credited back to their bank card, but VyaparMedia never debits their wallet balance or freezes the funds. The brand receives free wallet balance at the platform's expense.

---

### Invariant I6: Withdrawal Integrity & Cooling Periods
*Velocity limits, new bank account cooling period, name match, KYC tier gating.*

#### Flawed Bank Account Cooling Period Check
In `src/lib/fraud-detection/payment.ts:98`:
```typescript
if (user) {
  const accountAgeDays = Math.floor((Date.now() - user.createdAt.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  if (accountAgeDays < NEW_ACCOUNT_AGE_DAYS_THRESHOLD && params.amount > NEW_ACCOUNT_LARGE_WITHDRAWAL_THRESHOLD_PAISE) {
    flags.push({ rule: "LARGE_WITHDRAWAL_NEW_ACCOUNT", severity: "HIGH", description: `...` });
    riskScore += newAccountWeight;
  }
}
```
- The rule is titled `LARGE_WITHDRAWAL_NEW_ACCOUNT`.
- However, the code compares `Date.now() - user.createdAt.getTime()`.
- **Security Flaw**: If a creator account is 90 days old, and an attacker compromises the account (session theft or credentials leak), adds a **brand new bank account** and immediately requests a large withdrawal (e.g. ₹50,000), `accountAgeDays` is evaluated as 90 days!
- The cooling period check completely fails to detect the newly linked bank account beneficiary. The check must evaluate `bankAccount.createdAt` or `bankAccount.verifiedAt`.

---

### Invariant I7: Dispute Resolution & Escrow Settlement
*Split amounts in paise, rounding remainder, Route transfer reversals, admin double-click.*

#### Critical Defect: Card-Funded Deal Dispute Settlement Breaks Brand Ledger
In `src/lib/dispute-mediator/transaction-helpers.ts:325-337`:
```typescript
if (!deal.reservedFromWallet) {
  if (!brandUserId) {
    throw AppError.badRequest("Brand owner missing during wallet dispute settlement");
  }

  // 1. Release the full escrow pending balance from the brand's wallet (decrement pendingBalance only)
  const escrowUpdate = await tx.wallet.updateMany({
    where: { userId: brandUserId, pendingBalance: { gte: totalAmount } },
    data: { pendingBalance: { decrement: totalAmount } },
  });
  if (escrowUpdate.count === 0) {
    throw AppError.badRequest("INSUFFICIENT_BRAND_ESCROW: Brand pending balance is insufficient for dispute settlement.");
  }

  // 2. Refund to card via Razorpay
  await handleRazorpayGatewayRefund(deal, brandRefund, analysis);
```
- When a deal is funded via card/gateway (`deal.reservedFromWallet === false`), the funds are held on Razorpay Route (`PaymentHold`).
- **The brand's `wallet.pendingBalance` was NEVER incremented when the deal was funded via card!**
- Yet during dispute settlement, line 331 unconditionally attempts to decrement `brandWallet.pendingBalance` by `totalAmount`.
- **Outcome A**: If the brand has no other active campaigns, `pendingBalance` is 0. `escrowUpdate.count === 0` -> Dispute crashes with `INSUFFICIENT_BRAND_ESCROW`, permanently locking the dispute resolution.
- **Outcome B**: If the brand happens to have another active wallet campaign, line 333 steals `totalAmount` from that unrelated campaign's escrow AND refunds the card, causing double-accounting leakage and breaking the other campaign.

---

### Invariant I8: Admin Actions & Treasury Protection
*Payout approve/reject idempotency, audit log written in same transaction, treasury account invariants.*

1. **Missing Database AuditLog on Admin Payout Action (`src/app/api/admin/payouts/[id]/route.ts:72, 141`)**:
   - The route executes `logger.info("Admin REJECT payout", ...)` and `logger.info("Admin APPROVE payout...", ...)`.
   - It **fails to insert an `AuditLog` row** in Prisma within the transaction. If application server logs rotate or stdout is lost, there is zero verifiable database provenance of which administrator authorized or rejected a monetary withdrawal.
2. **Missing DB Delete-Protection for TDS Treasury (`src/lib/db.ts:478-520`)**:
   - PostgreSQL triggers `trg_protect_treasury` and `trg_protect_treasury_wallet` protect user `PLATFORM_TREASURY`.
   - User `TDS_WITHHOLDING_TREASURY` (`userId: "TDS_WITHHOLDING_TREASURY"`) has **zero deletion triggers** installed. An accidental admin deletion or script cascade will delete the tax withholding liability account.

---

### Invariant I9: Unit Hygiene (Paise vs. Rupee Consistency)
*Grep near amounts for `* 100`, `/ 100`, `toFixed`, `parseFloat`, `Math.round`, `Number(...)` and prove paise/rupee never mix.*

#### Direct Public API Unit Inconsistency
1. `/api/wallet/add-funds` (`src/app/api/wallet/add-funds/route.ts:89`):
   ```typescript
   const addFundsSchema = z.object({
     amount: z.preprocess(Number, z.number().int().min(100).max(500000))
   });
   const amountInPaise = parsed.data.amount * 100;
   ```
   **Accepts Rupees** from the client (e.g. `500` = ₹500) and multiplies by 100.
2. `/api/payments/withdraw` (`src/lib/validations/payment.ts:4-19`):
   ```typescript
   export const withdrawalSchema = z.object({
     amount: z.preprocess(Number, z.number().int().positive().min(env.MIN_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT).max(env.MAX_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT))
   });
   ```
   Where `env.MIN_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT = 50000` (paise).
   **Accepts Paise** from the client (e.g. `50000` = ₹500).

If a client or automated script passes paise (`50000`) to `/api/wallet/add-funds`, it is multiplied by 100 to ₹50,000! Conversely, passing rupees (`500`) to `/api/payments/withdraw` fails validation with "Minimum withdrawal is INR 500". This violates the uniform paise convention across API boundaries.

---

### Invariant I10: Webhook Replay, Signatures & DLQ Retries
*Signature over RAW body, constant-time compare, replay protection, out-of-order events, unknown event types, DLQ behavior.*

1. **HMAC Signature & Timing Attacks**:
   - `src/lib/razorpay.ts:1008`: Uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual(sigBuffer, expectedBuffer)`.
   - Verified over raw request text body (`rawBody = await request.text()`). **SECURE**.
2. **Dead Letter Queue Replay Blocked by False Acknowledgement (`src/app/api/admin/jobs/dlq/route.ts:110` vs `src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts:69`)**:
   - In `payments/webhook/route.ts`, if an event is processed or falls through, `isWebhookProcessed(eventId)` records it in `ProcessedWebhookEvent`.
   - If an admin inspects a failed or dropped webhook job in the Admin DLQ UI (`/api/admin/jobs/dlq`) and clicks "Retry", line 111 dispatches it with a new QStash deduplication ID:
     ```typescript
     publishOptions.deduplicationId = `${deadJob.deduplicationId}-retry-${Date.now()}`;
     ```
   - When the webhook processor receives the retried job, line 69 checks `await isWebhookProcessed(eventId)`.
   - Because `ProcessedWebhookEvent` was already recorded during the initial ingestion, it immediately returns:
     ```json
     { "success": true, "message": "Duplicate webhook ignored (already processed)" }
     ```
   - **Manual DLQ re-execution is impossible** without manually tampering with the PostgreSQL `ProcessedWebhookEvent` table.

## 3. Formal Audit Findings Log

| ID | Severity | Label | Area | File:Line | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P6-MONEY-01** | **P0** | **CONFIRMED** | Gateway Webhooks | `src/app/api/webhooks/razorpay/process/route.ts:454` | Razorpay refund & chargeback webhooks are ignored and marked processed, allowing free wallet balance extraction. |

### Detailed Findings Breakdown

#### P6-MONEY-01: Razorpay Refunds & Chargebacks Unhandled (P0)
- **Area**: Payment Webhook Ingestion
- **File:Line**: `src/app/api/webhooks/razorpay/process/route.ts:453-456`
- **What happens**:
  When a cardholder issues a chargeback via their bank or Razorpay issues a refund, Razorpay fires `refund.processed` or `chargeback.created`. The webhook handler logs nothing, marks the event as processed, and returns 200 OK. The brand gets their money back from the bank while their VyaparMedia wallet balance remains untouched.
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  // src/app/api/webhooks/razorpay/process/route.ts:453-456
  // Acknowledge unhandled event types
  await markWebhookProcessed(job.eventId, job.eventType, job.payload as Prisma.InputJsonValue);
  return { success: true, message: `Event type ${event} acknowledged` };
  ```
- **Why existing guards do not catch it**:
  `verifyWebhookSignature` passes because it is a valid signature from Razorpay. The event processor checks `event.startsWith("payment.")`, `payout.`, `transfer.`, but has no handlers for `refund.` or `chargeback.`.
- **Repro / Test Idea**:
  Send a signed webhook with `event: "refund.processed"` and payload referencing a captured payment. Verify that the wallet balance is not debited.
- **Minimal Fix**:
  Implement `refund.processed` and `chargeback.created` handlers to debit the user wallet or create a `DebtClaim` if the balance is insufficient, and mark the deal/hold as refunded.
- **Regression Test**:
  Vitest test asserting that `refund.processed` decrements wallet balance or creates a debt claim.

---

#### P6-MONEY-02: Card-Funded Deal Dispute Settlement Breaks Brand Ledger (P0)
- **Area**: Dispute Mediation
- **File:Line**: `src/lib/dispute-mediator/transaction-helpers.ts:331-337`
- **What happens**:
  On card-funded deals (`deal.reservedFromWallet === false`), the mediator executes an atomic update requiring `brandWallet.pendingBalance >= totalAmount`. Because card-funded deals never increment `pendingBalance`, this either causes a fatal error (`INSUFFICIENT_BRAND_ESCROW`), blocking dispute resolution, or steals `pendingBalance` from unrelated active campaigns.
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  // src/lib/dispute-mediator/transaction-helpers.ts:331-337
  const escrowUpdate = await tx.wallet.updateMany({
    where: { userId: brandUserId, pendingBalance: { gte: totalAmount } },
    data: { pendingBalance: { decrement: totalAmount } },
  });
  if (escrowUpdate.count === 0) {
    throw AppError.badRequest("INSUFFICIENT_BRAND_ESCROW: Brand pending balance is insufficient for dispute settlement.");
  }
  ```
- **Why existing guards do not catch it**:
  Card-funded tests mocked `reservedFromWallet: true` or mocked brand wallets with artificial pending balances.
- **Repro / Test Idea**:
  Create a brand with 0 wallet balance and 0 pending balance. Create a deal with `reservedFromWallet: false` and a `PaymentHold`. Open a dispute and execute mediation. It throws `INSUFFICIENT_BRAND_ESCROW`.
- **Minimal Fix**:
  For card-funded deals (`!deal.reservedFromWallet`), do not decrement `brandWallet.pendingBalance`. Only release the gateway hold or refund via Razorpay.
- **Regression Test**:
  Test dispute resolution on a deal where `reservedFromWallet === false` and brand wallet `pendingBalance === 0`.

---

#### P6-MONEY-03: Timed-Out Admin Payouts Stuck in PROCESSING with No Reconciliation Cron (P0)
- **Area**: Admin Payout Execution
- **File:Line**: `src/app/api/admin/payouts/[id]/route.ts:158-163`
- **What happens**:
  If a network timeout occurs when calling RazorpayX `createPayout`, the route returns `status: "PROCESSING"`. However, `razorpayPayoutId` is null. The cron `reconcile-payouts` only queries `Deal`, so it never touches `Withdrawal`. Admins cannot approve or reject the withdrawal because the route requires `status IN ['PENDING', 'PENDING_REVIEW']`. The funds remain deducted from the creator's wallet and trapped in limbo.
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  // src/app/api/admin/payouts/[id]/route.ts:158-163
  if (isTimeoutOrNetworkError) {
    return {
      id: withdrawalId,
      status: "PROCESSING" as const,
      isTimeoutOrNetworkError: true,
    };
  }
  ```
- **Why existing guards do not catch it**:
  The developer assumed `reconcile-payouts` cron handles withdrawals, but inspection of `src/app/api/cron/reconcile-payouts/route.ts:68` reveals it exclusively processes `prisma.deal.findMany`.
- **Repro / Test Idea**:
  Mock `createPayout` to throw `ETIMEDOUT`. Call `PUT /api/admin/payouts/:id` with action `APPROVE`. The withdrawal is left in `PROCESSING`. Attempt to call `APPROVE` or `REJECT` again; it returns 409 Conflict. Run cron `reconcile-payouts`; withdrawal is untouched.
- **Minimal Fix**:
  Add withdrawal reconciliation to `reconcile-payouts` cron, and allow admins to retry ambiguous payouts if `razorpayPayoutId` is null.
- **Regression Test**:
  Verify cron processes `Withdrawal.findMany({ where: { status: 'PROCESSING', razorpayPayoutId: null } })`.

---

#### P6-MONEY-04: Application Accept Lacks Idempotency and Unique DB Index (P0)
- **Area**: Application Acceptance
- **File:Line**: `src/services/application/action.ts:180-190`
- **What happens**:
  If a brand user double-clicks "Accept Application" or network retries occur, two parallel transactions query `existingDeal`. In default `ReadCommitted` isolation, both see null, both decrement `pendingBalance`, and both insert a `Deal`.
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  // src/services/application/action.ts:180-189
  const existingDeal = await tx.deal.findFirst({
    where: {
      campaignId: application.campaignId,
      influencerId: application.influencerId,
      deletedAt: null,
      status: { not: "CANCELLED" },
    },
    select: { id: true },
  });
  if (existingDeal) throw AppError.badRequest("A deal already exists for this influencer");
  ```
- **Why existing guards do not catch it**:
  `prisma/schema.prisma` lines 705–730 define indices on `campaignId` and `influencerId` separately, but lack a composite unique constraint `@@unique([campaignId, influencerId])`.
- **Repro / Test Idea**:
  Fire two concurrent `POST /api/applications/:id/accept` requests with `Promise.all()`. Observe two Deal rows created and `pendingBalance` decremented twice.
- **Minimal Fix**:
  Add `@@unique([campaignId, influencerId])` in `prisma/schema.prisma` (filtering for non-cancelled if supported, or via partial index in PostgreSQL). Add `Idempotency-Key` header check to `/api/applications/[id]/accept`.
- **Regression Test**:
  Concurrency test executing 2 parallel accepts on the same application.

#### P6-MONEY-05: Shiprocket API Called Before DB Transaction Commits (P0)
- **Area**: Product Fulfillment & Shipping Billing
- **File:Line**: `src/services/deal/product.ts:208-255`
- **What happens**:
  `createCompleteShipment` is invoked prior to `prisma.$transaction`. Shiprocket creates the shipment and charges VyaparMedia's carrier account. If the subsequent database transaction fails (e.g. brand balance insufficient or DB lock conflict), the brand is not charged, but Shiprocket courier pickup remains active.
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  // src/services/deal/product.ts:209-228
  const shipment = await createCompleteShipment({ ... });
  const courierChargePaise = shipment.courierChargePaise || 0;
  const updatedDeal = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    // If this throws, Shiprocket shipment was already created!
    if (brandWallet.balance < courierChargePaise) throw AppError.badRequest(...);
  ```
- **Why existing guards do not catch it**:
  Pre-check outside transaction (`brandWallet.balance < courierChargePaise`) is non-locking and subject to race conditions.
- **Repro / Test Idea**:
  Set brand wallet balance to ₹10. Simulate a race where balance is drained right before `prisma.$transaction` runs. Shipment is booked on Shiprocket; DB transaction fails.
- **Minimal Fix**:
  Hold funds in escrow or execute DB wallet debit in a `PENDING_DISPATCH` state before calling Shiprocket. If Shiprocket fails, refund the debit in compensation.
- **Regression Test**:
  Simulate Shiprocket success followed by DB failure; verify compensation cancels shipment.

#### P6-MONEY-06: Phantom Ledger Debits Break Double-Entry Equivalence (P1)
- **Area**: Ledger Accounting & LIVE Engine
- **File:Line**: `src/lib/deal-settlement.ts:166-183`, `src/lib/wallet-debt.ts:204-214`
- **What happens**:
  Transactions of type `DEBIT` with `metadata.balanceImpact: false` are written to `Transaction`. Standard SQL queries summing credits and debits drift from `wallet.balance` by $2 \times \text{TDS}$. Settlement cron `reconcile-ledger-settlements` permanently alerts on false drift.
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  // src/lib/deal-settlement.ts:166-176
  await tx.transaction.create({
    data: {
      walletId: wallet.id,
      dealId: params.dealId,
      type: "DEBIT",
      amount: tdsAmount,
      status: "COMPLETED",
      description: `TDS deduction (Section ${appliedSection}, ${appliedRatePercent}) for deal: ${params.dealId}`,
      metadata: { balanceImpact: false, source: "tds_withholding" },
    },
  });
  ```
- **Why existing guards do not catch it**:
  `src/lib/ledger-guard.ts` was patched with a custom filter, but external reporting, database queries, and `reconcile-ledger-settlements` do not use this filter.
- **Repro / Test Idea**:
  Run standard SQL `SELECT balance, (SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN type IN ('CREDIT', 'REFUND') THEN amount ELSE -amount END) FROM "Transaction" WHERE "walletId" = "Wallet".id) FROM "Wallet"`. Observe mismatch for all creators who completed deals with TDS.
- **Minimal Fix**:
  Record double-entry ledger transactions properly: Credit `grossPayout`, Debit `tdsAmount`, leaving net balance on the wallet. Alternatively, use transaction type `INFORMATION` or `TAX_NOTICE` instead of `DEBIT`.
- **Regression Test**:
  Verify SQL ledger sum matches `wallet.balance` without inspecting JSON metadata.

#### P6-MONEY-07: New Account Cooling Period Evaluates User Age Instead of Bank Account Age (P1)
- **Area**: Fraud Detection & Payout Gate
- **File:Line**: `src/lib/fraud-detection/payment.ts:98-99`
- **What happens**:
  `accountAgeDays` is calculated using `user.createdAt`. If an attacker gains access to an aged user account and adds an attacker-controlled bank account, the cooling period rule (`LARGE_WITHDRAWAL_NEW_ACCOUNT`) is completely bypassed.
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  // src/lib/fraud-detection/payment.ts:98-99
  const accountAgeDays = Math.floor((Date.now() - user.createdAt.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  if (accountAgeDays < NEW_ACCOUNT_AGE_DAYS_THRESHOLD && params.amount > NEW_ACCOUNT_LARGE_WITHDRAWAL_THRESHOLD_PAISE) {
  ```
- **Why existing guards do not catch it**:
  Tests only checked freshly created user fixtures where `user.createdAt` and `bankAccount.createdAt` were identical.
- **Repro / Test Idea**:
  Create a user fixture with `createdAt: 180 days ago`. Add a new bank account with `createdAt: 5 minutes ago`. Request a withdrawal exceeding `NEW_ACCOUNT_LARGE_WITHDRAWAL_THRESHOLD_PAISE`. Verify `LARGE_WITHDRAWAL_NEW_ACCOUNT` flag is not triggered.
- **Minimal Fix**:
  Query `bankAccount.createdAt` and check `Date.now() - bankAccount.createdAt.getTime() < NEW_ACCOUNT_AGE_DAYS_THRESHOLD * 86400000`.
- **Regression Test**:
  Assert `LARGE_WITHDRAWAL_NEW_ACCOUNT` flag triggers on an old user with a new bank account.

---

#### P6-MONEY-08: Admin DLQ Retry Fails Silently Due to Duplicate Webhook Filter (P1)
- **Area**: Background Worker Operations & DLQ
- **File:Line**: `src/app/api/admin/jobs/dlq/route.ts:110-112`, `src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts:69`
- **What happens**:
  When an admin triggers a manual replay of a failed webhook job from the DLQ dashboard, the replayed request is rejected by `isWebhookProcessed(eventId)` because the event ID was already recorded during the initial ingestion attempt. The retry silently fails without reprocessing.
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  // src/app/api/admin/jobs/dlq/route.ts:110-112
  if (deadJob.deduplicationId) {
    publishOptions.deduplicationId = `${deadJob.deduplicationId}-retry-${Date.now()}`;
  }
  // But payments/webhook/route.ts:69 checks eventId:
  const alreadyProcessed = await isWebhookProcessed(eventId);
  if (alreadyProcessed) return NextResponse.json({ success: true, message: "Duplicate webhook ignored" });
  ```
- **Why existing guards do not catch it**:
  `deduplicationId` is updated for QStash, but the internal business payload retains the original `eventId`.
- **Repro / Test Idea**:
  Ingest a webhook that fails during processing. Replay it via `POST /api/admin/jobs/dlq`. Verify response is `Duplicate webhook ignored` and worker does not run.
- **Minimal Fix**:
  When retrying a DLQ job, allow the processor to bypass the idempotency check or append a retry qualifier to `eventId`.
- **Regression Test**:
  Test DLQ manual retry successfully executes job handler.

---

#### P6-MONEY-09: Unit Inconsistency: Rupees vs Paise Across Public Wallet Endpoints (P2)
- **Area**: API Input Validation
- **File:Line**: `src/app/api/wallet/add-funds/route.ts:89`, `src/lib/validations/payment.ts:4-19`
- **What happens**:
  `/api/wallet/add-funds` expects Rupees (`amount * 100`), while `/api/payments/withdraw` expects Paise (`parsed.data.amount` checked against `MIN_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT = 50000`). Clients sending paise to `add-funds` are charged 100x.
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  // src/app/api/wallet/add-funds/route.ts:89
  const amountInPaise = parsed.data.amount * 100;
  
  // src/lib/validations/payment.ts:11-18
  z.number().int().positive().min(env.MIN_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT) // 50000 paise
  ```
- **Why existing guards do not catch it**:
  Each endpoint was developed in isolation by different engineers without enforcing a shared Zod schema convention for currency inputs.
- **Repro / Test Idea**:
  Call `POST /api/wallet/add-funds` with `{ "amount": 50000 }`. Observe that Razorpay order is generated for ₹50,00,000.
- **Minimal Fix**:
  Standardize all monetary endpoints to accept `amountPaise` (integer paise) or explicitly name the field `amountRupees`.
- **Regression Test**:
  Zod schema contract tests validating unit expectations across all payment endpoints.

---

#### P6-MONEY-10: Admin Payout Approval/Rejection Omits AuditLog Records (P2)
- **Area**: Admin Security & Governance
- **File:Line**: `src/app/api/admin/payouts/[id]/route.ts:72, 141`
- **What happens**:
  When an administrator approves or rejects a withdrawal payout, the action is only logged to ephemeral console logs (`logger.info`). No row is written to `AuditLog`.
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  // src/app/api/admin/payouts/[id]/route.ts:72-76
  logger.info(`Admin REJECT payout`, {
    withdrawalId,
    action: "REJECT",
    adminId,
  });
  return result;
  ```
- **Why existing guards do not catch it**:
  Linting does not enforce `createActivityLog` calls on admin routes.
- **Repro / Test Idea**:
  Execute an admin payout rejection. Query `prisma.auditLog.findMany({ where: { targetId: withdrawalId } })`. Result is empty.
- **Minimal Fix**:
  Insert `createActivityLog({ userId: adminId, action: "ADMIN_PAYOUT_" + action, ... })` inside the database transaction.
- **Regression Test**:
  Assert `AuditLog` row is created on payout approval and rejection.

## 6. Top 10 Risks by Priority

1. **[P0] P6-MONEY-01 (Unhandled Razorpay Chargebacks/Refunds)**: Brands can perform bank chargebacks or dashboard refunds while keeping wallet credits.
2. **[P0] P6-MONEY-02 (Card-Funded Dispute Settlement Crash)**: Dispute settlement on card-funded deals crashes or steals money from other campaigns.
3. **[P0] P6-MONEY-03 (Stuck Payout Timeout Limbo)**: Network timeout during payout approval permanently locks creator funds without recovery.
4. **[P0] P6-MONEY-04 (Application Accept Double-Debit Race)**: Missing composite unique constraint on `Deal` allows concurrent duplicate deal creation and double escrow debit.
5. **[P0] P6-MONEY-05 (Shiprocket Carrier Charge Leakage)**: Shipments created before DB transaction commit leave platform liable for unbilled shipping costs.
6. **[P1] P6-MONEY-06 (Phantom Ledger Debits)**: TDS entries recorded with `balanceImpact: false` break double-entry ledger audits and reconciliation crons.
7. **[P1] P6-MONEY-07 (Cooling Period User Age Bypass)**: Fraud rule inspects user age rather than bank account age, enabling drained accounts on compromised mature profiles.
8. **[P1] P6-MONEY-08 (DLQ Replay Silent Failure)**: Retrying dropped webhooks fails because `isWebhookProcessed` checks the original event ID.
9. **[P2] P6-MONEY-09 (Rupee vs. Paise Unit Inconsistency)**: Public endpoints mix rupees and paise, creating potential 100x overcharge risks.
10. **[P2] P6-MONEY-10 (Admin Payout Missing Audit Logs)**: Admin approval and rejection omit persistent `AuditLog` rows.

## 7. False Claims in Repository Documentation

1. **Claim in `ACTION_VALIDATION_AUDIT.md:14`**: *"All financial endpoints strictly enforce idempotency headers and prevent duplicate state changes."*
   - **FALSE**: `/api/deals/[id]/fund` falls back to `Date.now()` when the header is omitted, generating unique keys for rapid clicks. `/api/applications/[id]/accept` has zero idempotency headers or claim checks.
2. **Claim in `FEATURE_VERIFICATION.md:88`**: *"Withdrawal reconciliation cron automatically recovers failed or timed-out payouts with Razorpay."*
   - **FALSE**: `src/app/api/cron/reconcile-payouts/route.ts:68` exclusively queries `prisma.deal`. There is no cron in the codebase reconciling stuck `Withdrawal` records.
3. **Claim in `PRD.md:120`**: *"Double-entry accounting ensures total ledger credits minus debits perfectly equals stored wallet balance at all times."*
   - **FALSE**: `creditInfluencerPayoutWithTax` and `wallet-debt.ts` create `DEBIT` entries with `metadata.balanceImpact: false`. `SUM(credits) - SUM(debits)` drifts from `wallet.balance` by double the withheld tax.
4. **Claim in `docs/MARKETPLACE_FLOWS_AUDIT.md:45`**: *"New bank account cooling period prevents withdrawals to recently added bank accounts."*
   - **FALSE**: `src/lib/fraud-detection/payment.ts:98` checks `user.createdAt`, allowing immediate large withdrawals to brand-new bank accounts on older user profiles.
