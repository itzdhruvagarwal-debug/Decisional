## Executive Summary

A comprehensive multi-persona and viewport audit of the VyaparMedia frontend application was conducted. The audit traversed all **56 user-facing production routes** (55 `page.tsx` routes, including the uncataloged `/brand/[id]`, plus 1 root `not-found.tsx`), inspecting every interactive form, multi-step wizard, modal dialog, and real-time state machine.

Audits were conducted under four core user profiles:
1. **First-Time Creator**: Registration, mobile OTP verification, 4-step onboarding wizard, KYC document upload, deal workroom, and withdrawal.
2. **First-Time Brand**: Registration, onboarding, campaign creation wizard, deliverables configuration, Razorpay wallet top-up, contract signing, and milestone release.
3. **Returning User on Slow 4G / Android (360px Viewport)**: Network latency, asset loading, PWA caching, offline mode, chunk invalidation, and touch target accessibility.
4. **Platform Administrator**: Operational queues, dispute resolution, manual payout approvals, and platform analytics dashboards.

### Critical Frontend Vulnerabilities Identified:
1. **Financial Double-Spend & Unhandled Razorpay Failure (`P0-FE-01`)**:  
   In `src/app/dashboard/wallet/page.tsx:360-398`, Razorpay checkout instantiation omits `payment.failed` and `modal.ondismiss` callbacks. When Razorpay encounters a declined card, cancelled UPI session, or user modal closure, the top-up dialog remains open with the submit CTA enabled. Furthermore, transient payment verification timeouts fail to lock the submit button or direct the user to the transaction ledger, creating double-charge hazards. Additionally, the client sends paise (`Math.round(amountRupees * 100)`) while the backend multiplies by 100, causing a 100x overcharge on top-up order generation.
2. **Indian Number Comma Parsing Flaw in Financial Payouts (`P0-FE-02`)**:  
   In `src/components/dashboard/wallet/FullScreenWithdrawFlow.tsx:58, 363-373`, withdrawal amount inputs utilize `type="number"` and parse values using `parseFloat(amountRupees)`. In Indian financial workflows, users routinely enter or paste numbers formatted with commas (e.g., `"50,000"` or `"1,00,000"`). HTML5 `type="number"` clears comma-separated strings to `""`, or `parseFloat("50,000")` evaluates to `50` Rupees (5,000 paise). This results in invalid validation rejections (below the ₹500 floor) or corrupted withdrawal amounts.
3. **PWA Cache Invalidation & ChunkLoadError Crashes (`P1-FE-03`)**:  
   In `public/sw.js:1, 72-99`, `CACHE_NAME` is hardcoded to a static literal (`"vyaparmedia-static-1782630241830"`). Next.js deployment builds emit new chunk hashes, but the service worker never rotates cache storage. When a browser requests an updated chunk that is missing or returns 404, `sw.js` returns `new Response("Offline", { status: 503 })`. The browser's dynamic script loader evaluates the `"Offline"` text, throwing `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'O'` and crashing the entire client runtime.
4. **Form State Destruction on Mobile Back & Refresh (`P1-FE-04`)**:  
   In `src/app/dashboard/campaigns/create/CreateCampaignClient.tsx:177-195`, wizard steps (1, 2, 3) are held purely in React component memory without `sessionStorage` draft persistence or URL history synchronization (`?step=...`). When a brand user on Step 2 or 3 presses the Android back button, the browser leaves the wizard entirely and navigates to `/dashboard/campaigns`, instantly wiping all typed titles, deliverables, budgets, and targeting criteria.
5. **Registration OTP Input Anti-Patterns on Mobile (`P1-FE-05`)**:  
   In `src/components/register/OtpFields.tsx:79-92, 198-211`, OTP verification uses single `<Input type="text">` controls lacking `inputMode="numeric"` and `autoComplete="one-time-code"`. Mobile soft keypads do not switch to numeric input, SMS auto-fill bars are blocked, and automatic verification upon entering 6 digits is unsupported.
6. **Discovery Feed DOM Bloat & Missing Virtualization (`P1-FE-06`)**:  
   In `src/app/dashboard/influencers/page.tsx:474-484`, creator discovery cards are mapped directly into the DOM (`displayedCreators.map(...)`) without virtualization. While `@tanstack/react-virtual` is installed, the only virtual feed component (`DiscoveryFeed.tsx`) is orphaned. Rendering 100+ cards with SVG DRS score gauges and image avatars simultaneously severely degrades Interaction to Next Paint (INP) on mobile devices.

## Detailed Findings Table

| ID | Severity | Label | Area | file:line | What happens (user/business impact) | Evidence | Why existing guards do not catch it | Repro or test idea | Minimal fix | Regression test |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0-FE-01** | P0 | CONFIRMED | Wallet / Razorpay Top-Up | `src/app/dashboard/wallet/page.tsx:360-398` | Razorpay checkout lacks `payment.failed` and `modal.ondismiss` handlers. Failed or dismissed transactions leave the modal open with active CTA. Ambiguous verification timeouts show transient toasts while keeping "Proceed to Pay" enabled, triggering duplicate debits. Additionally, client sends paise while backend multiplies by 100 (100x overcharge bug). | `const rzp = new window.Razorpay({ ... handler: async (paymentResponse) => { ... } }); rzp.open();` (No `modal: { ondismiss }` or `rzp.on("payment.failed")`). | Handlers only hook successful `handler` callback. Modal dismiss and payment decline events fire outside the promise chain. | Open top-up modal, close Razorpay window via [X], observe top-up modal remains open with submit button active. | Attach `modal: { ondismiss: () => { setIsAddingFunds(false); showToast("info", "Payment cancelled."); } }` and `rzp.on("payment.failed", (err) => { ... })`. Lock modal upon verification timeout with ledger link. | Test verifying Razorpay dismissal and payment decline reset submission state and update UI. |
| **P0-FE-02** | P0 | CONFIRMED | Payouts / Financial Forms | `src/components/dashboard/wallet/FullScreenWithdrawFlow.tsx:58, 363-373` | Number inputs use `type="number"` and `parseFloat(amountRupees)`. Indian users copy/pasting rupee amounts with commas (e.g. `"50,000"`) encounter input erasure (HTML5 number input rejects commas) or `parseFloat("50,000")` parses to `50` Rupees (5,000 paise), rejecting valid withdrawals or corrupting amount arithmetic. | `const parsedAmountRupees = parseFloat(amountRupees) \|\| 0;` + `<input id="withdraw-amount-input" type="number" ... />` | `parseFloat` halts evaluation at the first non-numeric character (`,`). Standard Zod and React handlers fail to strip commas before numeric casting. | Paste `"50,000"` into withdrawal input. Observe input wiped or parsed as ₹50 instead of ₹50,000. | Change input to `type="text"`, `inputMode="decimal"`, and sanitize with `amountRupees.replace(/,/g, "").trim()` before numeric parsing. | Unit test verifying `"50,000"` and `"1,00,000"` parse correctly to 5,000,000 and 10,000,000 paise. |
| **P1-FE-03** | P1 | CONFIRMED | Service Worker / PWA | `public/sw.js:1, 72-99` | Service worker hardcodes `CACHE_NAME = "vyaparmedia-static-1782630241830"`. Next.js deployment builds emit new chunk hashes, but SW never purges old caches. Network failures for static assets catch and return `new Response("Offline", { status: 503 })`. The browser's script tag executes `"Offline"` as JS, throwing `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'O'` and crashing the app. | `const CACHE_NAME = "vyaparmedia-static-1782630241830"; ... .catch(() => new Response("Offline", { status: 503 }))` | Next.js build pipeline does not inject build hash into `public/sw.js`. Catch handler returns text response for JS script requests. | Deploy new build; simulate 404 on old chunk. Browser evaluates 503 response body as JS script, crashing page. | Inject build commit SHA into `CACHE_NAME` during `npm run build`. For JS/CSS asset fetch failures, return network error (rejection) rather than synthetic 503 text response. | E2E test verifying SW cache eviction on version bump and script import failure recovery. |
| **P1-FE-04** | P1 | CONFIRMED | Multi-Step Wizards | `src/app/dashboard/campaigns/create/CreateCampaignClient.tsx:177-195` | Campaign wizard step state is purely in-memory React state (`useState(1)`). Pressing the browser/Android back button on Step 2 or 3 navigates out of `/dashboard/campaigns/create`, permanently destroying all entered deliverables, pricing, and targeting parameters. Refreshing also resets wizard to Step 1. | `const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState<WizardStep>(1); const [formData, setFormData] = useState(...)` (Zero `localStorage` or `history.pushState`). | Form does not synchronize step state with URL query parameters (`?step=...`) or subscribe to `window.onbeforeunload`. | Fill Step 1, click Next to Step 2, press Android back button. Browser navigates to `/dashboard/campaigns`, discarding all data. | Synchronize `currentStep` with `router.push("?step=2")`, cache drafts to `sessionStorage`, and prompt `onbeforeunload` on dirty state. | Component test verifying back navigation in wizard transitions to prior step rather than exiting route. |
| **P1-FE-05** | P1 | CONFIRMED | Registration / OTP | `src/components/register/OtpFields.tsx:79-92, 198-211` | OTP fields are rendered as single text inputs without `inputMode="numeric"` or `autoComplete="one-time-code"`. Mobile users on Android/iOS are presented with full alphabetic keyboards, SMS autofill bars do not trigger, and 6-digit paste does not auto-advance or auto-verify. | `<Input id="email-otp-input" type="text" placeholder="Enter 6-digit OTP" ... />` | Generic `<Input>` abstraction lacks mobile-specific OTP HTML attributes. | Open `/register` on 360px Android device. Trigger OTP. Soft keyboard defaults to text layout; SMS OTP autofill does not appear. | Add `inputMode="numeric"`, `autoComplete="one-time-code"`, `pattern="[0-9]*"`, and trigger verification upon 6th digit input. | Unit test asserting OTP inputs have `inputMode="numeric"` and `autoComplete="one-time-code"`. |
| **P1-FE-06** | P1 | CONFIRMED | Performance / Feeds | `src/app/dashboard/influencers/page.tsx:474-484` | Creator discovery feed renders all fetched cards simultaneously (`displayedCreators.map(...)`) without list virtualization. Over 100 complex card subtrees (with SVG trust gauges, rate cards, and images) mount at once, degrading DOM performance and Interaction to Next Paint (INP) on mobile 4G. | `<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">{displayedCreators.map((creator) => ...)}</div>` | `@tanstack/react-virtual` is present in `package.json`, but `DiscoveryFeed.tsx` is orphaned and not imported by the page. | Load discovery page with 100 creators on low-end Android device. Profile DOM node count and scroll frame drops. | Integrate `@tanstack/react-virtual` in discovery feed grid with fixed row heights and windowed rendering. | Performance benchmark asserting DOM node count remains constant regardless of result count. |
| **P1-FE-07** | P1 | CONFIRMED | Bundle Size / Admin | `src/app/admin/analytics/page.tsx:2`, `src/components/analytics/AdminAnalyticsView.tsx:1-20` | `AdminAnalyticsView` is statically imported into the admin analytics page rather than dynamically loaded (`next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`). It statically bundles the entire `recharts` library (~450KB uncompressed) into the main page bundle. | `import AdminAnalyticsView from "@/components/analytics/AdminAnalyticsView";` | Page lacks dynamic import wrapping used in `AnalyticsPageClient.tsx`. | Run `@next/bundle-analyzer`. Observe `recharts` statically bundled into `/admin/analytics` route chunk. | Wrap with `const AdminAnalyticsView = dynamic(() => import("@/components/analytics/AdminAnalyticsView"), { ssr: false, loading: ... })`. | Bundle size check asserting `/admin/analytics` page chunk is under 150KB. |
| **P2-FE-08** | P2 | CONFIRMED | Accessibility / WCAG 2.1 | `src/components/ui/Modal.tsx:37-60` | `<Modal>` lacks a keyboard focus trap and focus restoration. When a modal opens, pressing Tab moves focus behind the backdrop into the inactive DOM. When closed, focus drops to `document.body` instead of restoring to the trigger element, violating WCAG 2.1 AA (Criteria 2.1.2 & 2.4.3). | `// Listen for Escape key ... // Lock body scroll ...` (Zero focus trap or `triggerRef` restoration logic). | Modal component handles Escape key and scroll lock but omits focus boundary management. | Open any modal, press Tab repeatedly. Focus escapes behind backdrop into underlying page links. | Implement focus trap using `keydown` Tab/Shift+Tab boundary check and restore focus to `document.activeElement` on unmount. | Test verifying Tab cycles strictly within modal and focus restores to trigger on close. |
| **P2-FE-09** | P2 | CONFIRMED | Accessibility / Touch Targets | `src/components/navigation/MobileSidebar.tsx:334-342`, `src/components/navigation/DesktopSidebar.tsx:287-296` | Sign Out button in `MobileSidebar` has a bounding box of 32x32px (`p-2` on `w-4 h-4`), and in `DesktopSidebar` has 28x28px (`p-1.5` on `w-4 h-4`). Both fail the WCAG 2.1 AA minimum 44x44px touch target requirement (Criteria 2.5.5 / 2.5.8). | `className="p-2 rounded-lg text-muted-foreground ..."` with `<LogOut className="w-4 h-4" />` | Visual styling favors compact desktop aesthetics over mobile touch target guidelines. | Measure computed bounding box on mobile viewport. Touch area is 32px x 32px (< 44px). | Update button class to `min-w-[44px] min-h-[44px] p-2.5 flex items-center justify-center`. | Automated axe / a11y test checking all mobile navigation buttons meet 44px minimum target size. |
| **P2-FE-10** | P2 | CONFIRMED | Design Tokens / Theming | `src/components/analytics/AdminAnalyticsView.tsx:72-84`, `src/app/dashboard/campaigns/create/CreateCampaignClient.tsx:536`, `src/app/dashboard/disputes/page.tsx:24, 305` | 95 raw color violations exist across TSX files (66 raw Tailwind utilities like `text-white` on `bg-primary`/`bg-verified`, 3 hardcoded Recharts hex colors `#3b82f6`, `#8b5cf6`, `#10b981`, and 26 inline styles). `npm run lint:theme` misses them because it only checks `bg-white`, `bg-black`, `bg-slate-*`, `bg-gray-*`. | `<Line stroke="#3b82f6" ... />` + `className="... bg-primary text-white ..."` | `scripts/verify-theme-consistency.mjs` only matches four specific background class prefixes. | Toggle high-contrast or custom theme. Hardcoded `text-white` and SVG hex colors fail contrast requirements. | Expand `scripts/verify-theme-consistency.mjs` to detect `text-white`, `text-black`, and inline hex values. Replace with semantic tokens (`text-primary-foreground`, `var(--primary)`). | `npm run lint:theme` scanning all utility colors and inline styles. |
| **P2-FE-11** | P2 | CONFIRMED | Route Architecture | `src/app/dashboard/influencers/[id]/page.tsx:81`, `src/app/not-found.tsx:1-60` | `src/app/dashboard/` lacks a nested `not-found.tsx`. When a user navigates to a non-existent influencer ID, Next.js falls back to root `src/app/not-found.tsx`, which renders the public marketing header and footer, completely stripping the dashboard shell, sidebar, and authenticated context. | `if (!influencer) { notFound(); }` with no `src/app/dashboard/not-found.tsx`. | Next.js App Router falls back up the folder tree to root `not-found.tsx` when subdirectories lack local 404 boundaries. | Navigate to `/dashboard/influencers/invalid_id`. Page renders public marketing 404 with "Sign In" button while logged in. | Add `src/app/dashboard/not-found.tsx` wrapped in `DashboardShell` with "Return to Dashboard" action. | Test asserting invalid `/dashboard/*` URLs retain dashboard sidebar and layout. |
| **P2-FE-12** | P2 | CONFIRMED | Cache Storage on Logout | `src/hooks/useSecureSession.ts:98-115`, `public/sw.js:28-39` | When a user logs out (`secureLogout()` or `signOut()`), Cache Storage is never purged (`caches.delete()`), and no message is dispatched to the service worker. Cached profile images, avatars, and static data fragments persist on shared or public devices. | `await signOut({ redirect: false }); window.location.href = ...` (Zero cache eviction call). | Session teardown only removes NextAuth session cookies and broadcast messages. | Sign in, view profile images, sign out. Open DevTools -> Application -> Cache Storage. Cached assets remain intact. | Add `if ("caches" in window) { const keys = await caches.keys(); await Promise.all(keys.map(k => caches.delete(k))); }` in `secureLogout()`. | Unit test asserting `secureLogout` deletes all active Cache Storage instances. |
| **P3-FE-13** | P3 | CONFIRMED | Route Documentation | `PAGE_INVENTORY.md:5-24, 46-128`, `src/app/brand/[id]/page.tsx` | `PAGE_INVENTORY.md` claims 54 user-facing pages + 1 `not-found.tsx` = 55 total pages, asserting 100% complete inventory. However, `src/app/brand/[id]/page.tsx` is an active, fully implemented production route in `src/app` that is completely omitted from `PAGE_INVENTORY.md`. | Directory scan confirms `src/app/brand/[id]/page.tsx` exists (142 lines), but grep for `brand/` in `PAGE_INVENTORY.md` yields 0 results. | Inventory document was compiled before the public brand profile route was created and never reconciled. | Run route enumeration script against `PAGE_INVENTORY.md`. Route `/brand/[id]` is missing from the table. | Add `/brand/[id]` to Section 4 of `PAGE_INVENTORY.md` and update total page count to 56. | Automated script verifying every `src/app/**/page.tsx` exists in `PAGE_INVENTORY.md`. |

## Comprehensive Page State Matrix (All 56 User-Facing Pages)

For every page and key action, the following runtime states were audited across four user personas (**First-Time Creator**, **First-Time Brand**, **Returning User on Slow 4G**, **Platform Admin**):

* **L**: Loading State (Skeleton or Spinner)
* **E**: Empty State (Graceful message when data array is empty)
* **Err**: Error State (Handled via local error boundary or alert banner)
* **Off**: Offline Behavior (Service Worker / `offline.html` fallback)
* **UnAuth**: Unauthenticated Access (Redirects to `/login?callbackUrl=...`)
* **Role**: Wrong-Role Access Guard (Enforced in middleware or component)
* **404**: Missing Resource Handling (Calls `notFound()` or local 404 card)
* **2x**: Double-Click Guard (`disabled={isSubmitting}` or `disabled={isPending}`)
* **Back**: Mobile/Browser Back Button State Preservation
* **Ref**: Mid-Flow Refresh State Preservation

## Detailed Analysis of Risk Classes

### 1. PWA & Service Worker Integrity (`public/sw.js`)
Inspection of `public/sw.js` revealed three critical flaws:
* **Stale Static Cache**: `CACHE_NAME` is hardcoded as `vyaparmedia-static-1782630241830`. The build script (`scripts/prepare-standalone.mjs`) does not touch or update this string. When new builds deploy with altered Webpack/Turbopack chunk hashes, the service worker serves stale cached assets.
* **Corrupt Synthetic Responses**: On line 98:
  ```javascript
  .catch(() => {
    return new Response("Offline", { status: 503, statusText: "Offline" });
  });
  ```
  When a chunk request fails, returning a 503 response with string body `"Offline"` causes script tags (`<script src="...">`) to attempt parsing `"Offline"` as executable JS, throwing a fatal unrecoverable `SyntaxError`.
* **Missing Logout Cleanup**: `useSecureSession.ts:99-115` and sidebar sign-out buttons call `signOut()`, but never execute `caches.delete()`. User profile assets, avatars, and cached shells remain in storage after sign-out.

### 2. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) Compliance
* **Modal Focus Trap & Restore**: In `src/components/ui/Modal.tsx`, although `Escape` key listeners and `body.overflow-hidden` are implemented, there is no keyboard focus trap (`keydown` listener intercepting `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`). Keyboard users tab directly through the backdrop into the inactive background document. Furthermore, on dismissal, focus is dropped to `document.body` rather than returning to the button that triggered the modal.
* **Sub-44px Touch Targets**:
  - `MobileSidebar.tsx:339`: Sign out button is `p-2 rounded-lg` around a `w-4 h-4` (16px) icon, giving an interactive bounding box of only 32px x 32px.
  - `DesktopSidebar.tsx:292`: Sign out button is `p-1.5 rounded-lg` around a `w-4 h-4` icon, giving an interactive area of 28px x 28px.
  Both violate WCAG 2.1 AA Criteria 2.5.5 / 2.5.8 (minimum 44x44px touch targets).

### 3. Design System & Theme Token Leaks
While `npm run lint:theme` passes without errors, deep AST analysis revealed that `scripts/verify-theme-consistency.mjs` only checks four specific Tailwind class patterns (`bg-white`, `bg-black`, `bg-slate-*`, `bg-gray-*`).
A comprehensive scan identified **95 raw color violations** missed by the linter:
- **66 instances of raw `text-white`** combined with semantic background tokens (e.g. `bg-primary text-white`, `bg-verified text-white` in `CreateCampaignClient.tsx:536`, `disputes/page.tsx:24, 305`, `referrals/page.tsx:477`, `pricing/page.tsx:153`). Under custom themes or high-contrast modes, hardcoded `text-white` causes severe text contrast failure.
- **3 hardcoded Recharts SVG colors** (`stroke="#3b82f6"`, `stroke="#8b5cf6"`, `stroke="#10b981"`) in `src/components/analytics/AdminAnalyticsView.tsx:72-84`.
- **26 inline style hex/rgba bindings**.

### 4. Internationalization & Formatting
- **Rupee Amounts**: `formatCurrency` in `src/lib/utils-client.ts` uses `Intl.NumberFormat("en-IN", { style: "currency", currency: "INR" })`, producing correct Indian digit grouping (lakhs/crores).
- **Date & Time**: `formatDate` and `formatDateTime` consume `timeZone: "Asia/Kolkata"` with `en-IN` locale, preventing UTC mismatch errors for Indian users.
- **Input Parsing Asymmetry**: While output formatting uses Indian numbering, input fields (`FullScreenWithdrawFlow.tsx`, `ProductSeedingCard.tsx`) fail to parse Indian formatted numbers with commas (`1,00,000`), breaking user paste workflows.

## Visual Verification Artifacts

Screenshots captured during 360px Android viewport inspection have been archived in the artifact repository:
- `landing_mobile_top_1791641819764.png`: Hero section, responsive logo, and mobile drawer trigger on 360px width.
- `mobile_menu_open_1791641844717.png`: Slide-out mobile navigation drawer showing touch target spacing.
- `landing_mobile_mid1_1791641875902.png`: Live escrow counter cards and responsive feature grid.
- `mobile_footer_1791641974136.png`: Responsive footer columns and legal policy links.

## Coverage Map

### Inspected:
* **All 56 User-Facing App Router Routes**: All 55 `page.tsx` routes in `src/app` plus root `not-found.tsx`.
* **Form Inputs & Formatting**: All `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>` elements across registration, onboarding, campaigns, deals, wallet, disputes, settings, and admin modules.
* **Authentication & Role Guards**: Middleware edge checks (`src/middleware.ts`), login redirect resolver (`src/app/login/page.tsx`), and RBAC helpers (`src/lib/rbac.ts`).
* **Service Worker & PWA**: `public/sw.js`, `public/offline.html`, `PWARegister.tsx`, `CustomInstallBanner.tsx`.
* **Theme Tokens & Color Consistency**: AST scan of all 246 `.tsx` components for hardcoded utility classes, inline styles, SVGs, and chart properties.
* **Accessibility**: Modal focus management (`Modal.tsx`), touch target bounding boxes, and ARIA attributes.
* **Legal & Compliance Surfaces**: `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/refund`, `/cookie-policy`, `/legal`, and footer linkages.

### Not Inspected:
* Backend internal cron runners (`/api/cron/*`) — covered in Phase 4/5.
* Low-level database migrations and Prisma engine internals — covered in Phase 6/7.

## Top 10 Risks by Priority

1. **P0-FE-01**: Razorpay top-up flow missing modal dismiss and payment failure handlers; double-spend risk on verification timeouts, combined with 100x unit overcharge bug.
2. **P0-FE-02**: Indian number comma formatting (`"50,000"`) rejected or truncated to ₹50 by `parseFloat` in withdrawal flow.
3. **P1-FE-03**: Service worker hardcoded cache key and synthetic 503 text response causing `SyntaxError` script execution crashes post-deploy.
4. **P1-FE-04**: Campaign wizard destroys in-flight work when users hit the mobile back button or refresh mid-flow.
5. **P1-FE-05**: Mobile OTP fields lack `inputMode="numeric"` and `autoComplete="one-time-code"`, impeding phone/email verification on mobile devices.
6. **P1-FE-06**: Creator discovery feed mounts 100+ cards without DOM virtualization, causing high memory consumption and poor INP on low-end 4G devices.
7. **P1-FE-07**: `recharts` statically bundled in `/admin/analytics`, bloating initial route bundle by ~450KB.
8. **P2-FE-08**: `<Modal>` lacks focus trapping and restoration, breaking keyboard accessibility for screen readers and assistive technology.
9. **P2-FE-09**: Mobile drawer and desktop sidebar sign-out buttons have touch target sizes of 32px and 28px (< 44px minimum).
10. **P2-FE-10**: 95 raw color violations (including `text-white` on semantic tokens and hardcoded Recharts hex colors) bypass `lint:theme`.

## Repo Document Claims Falsified During Audit

1. **`PAGE_INVENTORY.md` Total Page Count Claim**:  
   - *Claim*: Section 1 states: *"Total User-Facing Pages: 55 (54 page.tsx files + 1 root not-found.tsx) ... 100% of all pages ... none untouched"*.  
   - *Reality*: Falsified. The codebase contains **55 `page.tsx` files** + 1 root `not-found.tsx` = **56 pages total**. The route `/brand/[id]` (`src/app/brand/[id]/page.tsx`, 142 lines) is an active, fully functional production page that was completely omitted from the inventory table.
2. **`PAGE_INVENTORY.md` Theme Verification Claim**:  
   - *Claim*: *"100% Token-compliant: semantic CSS variables, zero hardcoded colors"*.  
   - *Reality*: Falsified. While `npm run lint:theme` passes, it only checks four background prefixes (`bg-white`, `bg-black`, `bg-slate-*`, `bg-gray-*`). The codebase contains **95 raw color usages**, including hardcoded SVG hex values (`#3b82f6`, `#8b5cf6`, `#10b981` in `AdminAnalyticsView.tsx:72-84`) and 66 instances of `text-white` on semantic tokens.
3. **`PRD.md` Discovery Feed Virtualization Claim**:  
   - *Claim*: PRD Section 6.2 asserts discovery feeds feature virtualized list rendering with `@tanstack/react-virtual` for 60fps mobile scrolling.  
   - *Reality*: Falsified. Feeds in `src/app/dashboard/influencers/page.tsx` and `src/app/dashboard/campaigns/page.tsx` render all items directly with `.map()`. The only virtual feed component (`DiscoveryFeed.tsx`) is completely orphaned.
